It provides a low cost to entry solution to users who may be making their first steps in the ArchiMate modelling language, or who are looking for a free, cross-platform ArchiMate modelling tool for their company or institution and wish to engage with the language within a TOGAF® or other Enterprise Architecture framework.</p><p>Since its introduction, Archi has been widely adopted for real-world use in the commercial and educational sectors and is used in-house by major global companies and consultants. It is rapidly becoming the de facto open source ArchiMate modelling tool.</p><p>The ArchiMate® modelling language is an open and independent Enterprise Architecture standard that supports the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across business domains. ArchiMate is one of the open standards hosted by The Open Group® and is fully aligned with TOGAF®.</p><p>Archi® is a registered trademark of Phillip Beauvoir.

Run the installer to install Archi to your system. Windows 7, 8 and 10 64-bit versions are supported. The installer simply copies the program files to the target directory and associates *.archimate files with Archi. An uninstaller is also included.</p><p>You can also install Archi manually with a zip installation. Unzip this file and run either the &quot;Archi&quot; or program file. Also included are some Windows batch files - &quot;RegisterFileAssociation.bat&quot; and &quot;UnregisterFileAssociation.bat&quot;. The first of these files will register the *.archimate file extension with Archi in the Windows Registry. The second batch file will unregister the file association.</p><p>The Mac and Linux versions are packaged in zip and tar.gz files respectively. Simply un- archive the downloaded archive file and double-click the &quot;Archi&quot; application file to launch the program.</p><h2 id="launching-archi"><a class="header-anchor" href="#launching-archi" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Launching Archi</h2><p>The new, blank Archi workspace looks like the following:</p><p>The Default Archi Workspace</p><p>The workspace is divided into the following sub-windows:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>- The Models Tree window. By default this is positioned at the top left and labelled\n&quot;Models&quot;. This is where one or more ArchiMate models can be viewed as a tree\nstructure.\n- The Properties window. This displays the properties for a selected object. The\nproperties for the selected object can be edited here.\n- The Outline window. This window displays the contents of an ArchiMate diagram\n(View) in miniature as a navigation tool for the selected diagram (View).\n- The Navigator window. This window displays the selected model concept and all\nof its relationships with other model concepts. It is used to navigate between\nconnected concepts via their relationships and is used in conjunction with the\nModels Tree window.\n- The Palette window. When opened will display a single window for the drawing\nPalette used in Views.\n- The Visualiser window. This window displays the selected model concept and all\nof its relationships with other model concepts in a graphical way. It is the\ngraphical equivalent of the Navigator.\n- The Hints window. This displays short textual hints for the selected object. For\nexample, selecting an ArchiMate &quot;Business Actor&quot; diagram element displays a\nshort summary of that object&#39;s meaning and purpose. Selecting an item or\nhovering over an item, in the diagram&#39;s palette also displays a hint in the window.\n- The Validator window. This provides hints and tips to improve your model.\n</code></pre></div><p>These sub-windows can be re-arranged by dragging them into new positions, or by dragging them out of the main application window to become detached from the main window.</p><p>The various windows may be shown or hidden by selecting the appropriate menu items from the &quot;Window&quot; menu on the main menu bar or from the buttons on the toolbar:</p><p>The Windows Toolbar</p><p>To reset the Archi window workspace to its default layout, select &quot;Reset Window Layout&quot; from the &quot;Window&quot; menu from the main menu.</p><p>You can hide or show the main toolbar by selecting &quot;Hide/Show Toolbar&quot; from the &quot;Window&quot; menu from the main menu.</p><h1 id="working-in-archi"><a class="header-anchor" href="#working-in-archi" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Working in Archi</h1><p>As you work in the application, you may wish to be aware of how things work generally.</p><h2 id="windows-and-tabs"><a class="header-anchor" href="#windows-and-tabs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Windows and Tabs</h2><p>The main editing area for Views is in the central-right portion of the application.

You may change this by renaming it directly in the Model Tree or selecting it in the Model Tree and editing the name in the Properties Window. You may also add a &quot;Purpose&quot; here in the Properties Window describing the purpose and aims of the model.</p><p>Note also that one &quot;View&quot; has automatically been created for the model and named &quot;Default View&quot; and is placed in the &quot;Views&quot; folder in the Model Tree. If the View is not open (i.e. visible with blank drawing canvas and palette) you can open it by double- clicking on it in the Model Tree. Doing so will open the View (diagram) editor to the right. If you wish to rename the View, simply select it on the Model Tree and edit the name in the Properties Window.</p><p>The Models window can display more than one Model Tree which means that you can work on more than one model at the same time.</p><p>The asterisk that appears on a model in the Tree when changes have been made indicates that this model was changed, but that the changes have not yet been saved.</p><h1 id="the-model-tree"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-model-tree" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Model Tree</h1><p>An ArchiMate model consists of a number of ArchiMate concepts belonging to different &quot;layers&quot; - the &quot;Business&quot; layer, the &quot;Application&quot; layer and the &quot;Technology&quot; layer. Each ArchiMate concept belongs to one of these layers. For example, a &quot;Business Object&quot; belongs to the &quot;Business&quot; layer and an &quot;Application Component&quot; belongs to the Application layer.</p><p>Each concept in the model can connect to one or more other concepts via one or more relationships (connections) according to the rules of ArchiMate.</p><p>It is beyond the scope of this guide to explain these concepts and their relationships. For more information refer to the ArchiMate Specification)</p><p>An ArchiMate model consists of configurations of these concepts connected to each other via the various relationships. An ArchiMate model is represented in Archi in the &quot;Models&quot; window as a tree structure organised into folders:</p><p>The Model Tree window showing an example model</p><p>Each ArchiMate concept is placed into its appropriate folder in the Model Tree.</p><p>Adding Elements Directly to the Model Tree</p><p>To add new ArchiMate elements directly to the Model Tree, select one of the folders, &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Application&quot;, &quot;Technology&quot; or &quot;Connectors&quot; and right-click. A &quot;New&quot; menu item allows you to add new elements to the tree:</p><p>Adding a new element directly to the Model Tree</p><p>When the element is added to the Model Tree, the focus is given to the element and you can provide a new name for it.</p><p>Note that it is not possible to add relationships directly to the Model Tree as these can only be added by drawing them in the View (diagram) editor window.</p><p>Folders and Organisation</p><p>A model in Archi is organised into a folder structure representing the ArchiMate layers and the concepts&#39; relationships. A new model comprises the following top level folders:</p><p>Business Contains the elements in the &quot;Business&quot; layer and any user- created sub-folders</p><p>Application Contains the elements in the &quot;Application&quot; layer and any user- created sub-folders</p><p>Technology Contains the elements in the &quot;Technology&quot; layer and any user- created sub-folders</p><p>Motivation Contains the elements in the &quot;Motivation&quot; category and any user-created sub-folders</p><p>Implementation &amp; Migration</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Contains the elements in the &quot;Implementation &amp; Migration&quot;\ncategory and any user-created sub-folders\n</code></pre></div><p>Other Contains the Location, Grouping, and Junction type elements and any user-created sub-folders</p><p>Relations Contains the relationships between concepts as they are created in Views (diagrams) and any user-created sub-folders</p><p>Views (^) Contains links to Views (diagrams) ArchiMate elements can be created and deleted directly in the Model Tree (see Adding Elements Directly to the Model Tree) or are automatically added to the appropriate type folder as objects are drawn onto the canvas of a View (see Adding New Elements to the View from the Palette). All concepts in a folder are automatically sorted alphabetically. User-Created Sub-Folders User sub-folders can be created under the main top-level folders. This allows you to organise the concepts in any way you wish. To add a new sub-folder to the Model Tree, select a top-level folder (or a user-created sub-folder), and right-click. A &quot;New&quot; menu item allows you to add a new sub-folder to the tree. Note that a sub-folder can only contain concepts of the same type as the topmost parent folder. For example, only &quot;Business&quot; type concepts can be created in the &quot;Business&quot; folder and any of its sub-folders. You can also drag and drop concepts and sub-folders within the same folder branch, but not across folders of different types. To rename a sub-folder in the Model Tree choose &quot;Rename&quot; from the main Edit menu or from the right-click context menu. Working in the Model Tree Generally, you can add, delete, duplicate, move, and rename concepts and Views in the Model Tree. You can also create folders under the main folder groupings in order to group concepts together.</p><p>Drag and drop</p><p>Objects are managed with drag and drop in folders. Note that you cannot move concepts from one main folder type to another. For example, Business concepts can only be in the &quot;Business&quot; folder or one of its sub-folders, and relationships can only be in the &quot;Relations&quot; folder or one of its sub-folders.</p><p>Cut and Paste</p><p>In addition to drag and drop you can cut and paste objects between folders. After selecting objects in the tree select &quot;Cut&quot; and, after selecting the target folder, select &quot;Paste&quot; to move the objects.</p><p>Deleting Objects from the Model Tree</p><p>To delete one or more objects in the Model Tree select them and choose &quot;Delete&quot; from the main &quot;Edit&quot; menu or from the main toolbar.</p><p>Note that if a concept that you wish to delete appears in one or more Views you will be warned that it is referenced in those Views. If you then delete the concept from the tree you will also delete it from any Views where it is referenced.</p><p>Warning about deleting a concept</p><p>Renaming an Object in the Model Tree</p><p>To rename an object in the Model Tree choose &quot;Rename&quot; from the main Edit menu or from the right-click context menu. You can also rename it in the Properties Window.</p><p>Duplicating an Element or View in the Model Tree</p><p>To duplicate Elements or Views in the Model Tree select &quot;Duplicate&quot; from the main &quot;Edit&quot; menu or from the right-click context menu. Note that Duplicate Views contain references to the original concepts copied.</p><p>Editing Properties for an Object in the Model Tree</p><p>To edit the Properties for a selected object in the Model Tree, select the object in the tree and open the Properties Window either by double-clicking the object or from the main &quot;Window&quot; menu or main toolbar.</p><p>Each object in the Model Tree has different properties that can be set or viewed in the Properties Window. For more information see the section, The Properties Window.</p><p>Note - some properties can only be edited when the object is selected in a View (for example, the fill colour, font or line width).</p><p>Concepts in the Model Tree and Views</p><p>Concepts in the Model Tree can be added to any number of diagram Views in the model by dragging them onto the View&#39;s canvas (see the section, &quot;Views&quot;). When a concept has been added or used in a View the font used in the Model Tree for that concept is normal. However, if the concept only exists in the Model Tree and is not used in any View it is shown with an italic font:</p><p>Italic font shows concepts not used in Views</p><p>This makes it convenient to see those concepts that may have become redundant and can be deleted.</p><p>Synchronising Selections in the Model Tree and a View</p><p>When selecting concepts in the Model Tree and in diagram Views it is sometimes useful to synchronise the selection between the concepts in both windows. Pressing the &quot;Link to View&quot; button in the Model Tree window enables or disables synchronising selected concepts between the Model Tree and a diagram:</p><p>The &quot;Link to View&quot; button</p><p>This button is a toggle and can be turned off or on.</p><p>Synchronised selection is possible on more than one selected concept.</p><p>Note that synchronised selection is only possible if a relevant View is open. Selecting a concept in the Model Tree will not synchronise a selection in a View if that View does not contain that particular concept or concepts.</p><p>Drill Down</p><p>Using the Drill Down buttons, &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Go Into&quot;, it is possible to &quot;drill into&quot; a model or folder. The path to the currently selected object or folder is shown in the Status Bar.</p><p>The &quot;Drill Down&quot; buttons</p><p>Searching and Filtering in the Model Tree</p><p>The number of objects in the Model Tree can grow quite considerably as you work on your model. Of course, you may wish to add sub-folders within the main folder structure</p><p>to help organise these objects. However, finding a particular object in the tree may still prove to be difficult.</p><p>In order to search the Model Tree a Search Bar is included in Archi. This is accessed by clicking on the &quot;Search&quot; button on the toolbar of the Model Tree window. Clicking this button reveals the Search Bar:</p><p>The Search Bar revealed</p><p>As you type into the text field of the Search Bar the Model Tree updates to show only those objects that match the search criteria in the Search Bar. By default only the name of the objects is matched to the search string. You can also search on the &quot;Documentation&quot; field of the objects by ticking this in the &quot;Filter Options&quot; drop-down menu in the Search Bar:</p><p>Searching on both &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Documentation&quot;</p><p>To clear the search text selection click on the icon to the right of the text. To clear the filters, deselect &quot;Name&quot; and/or &quot;Documentation&quot;.</p><p>Filtering Object Types</p><p>To filter certain types of ArchiMate concept you can select the different types to include in the filter/search in the drop-down menu:</p><p>Filtering certain object types</p><p>To reset the object-type filter, select the &quot;Reset Filters&quot; menu item.</p><p>Filtering User Properties</p><p>To filter User Properties of objects you can select the different Property keys to include in the filter/search in the drop-down menu:</p><p>Filtering on User Properties</p><p>Showing All Folders</p><p>As you refine your search the Model Tree will only show those objects that match your search/filter criteria (or none at all if no objects match). Thus, folders with no matching child objects are not shown. If however you wish to show these empty folders as you search for objects (you may wish to drag and drop objects to other folders, for example) then you can set this as an option in the filter menu by selecting &quot;Show All Folders&quot;.</p><p>To close the Search Bar and reset the search filter press the &quot;Search&quot; button one more time.</p><p>Find and Replace</p><p>It is also possible to find and replace objects in the Model Tree by name.</p><p>Find and Replace dialog</p><h1 id="views"><a class="header-anchor" href="#views" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Views</h1><p>The elements and relationships that constitute an ArchiMate model as represented in the Model Tree can be arranged into one or more &quot;Views&quot; or visual diagrams. Therefore an ArchiMate model can consist of one or more Views where each View can display the model concepts in various configurations. For example, you may wish to only see the Business Layer elements in one View and the model&#39;s Application Interface elements in another View. Or you may wish to create a &quot;master&quot; View that acts as a map to all of the other Views in the model.</p><p>ArchiMate advocates an approach in which architects and other stakeholders can define their own Views on the enterprise architecture. In this approach, Views are specified by viewpoints. Viewpoints define abstractions on the set of models representing the enterprise architecture, each aimed at a particular type of stakeholder and addressing a particular set of concerns. Viewpoints can both be used to view certain aspects in isolation, and for relating two or more aspects.</p><p>In Archi a View is unlimited in scope according to the available elements and relations, and it is up to the designer to impose any constraints for a given viewpoint as prescribed by the ArchiMate specification.</p><h2 id="opening-a-view"><a class="header-anchor" href="#opening-a-view" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Opening a View</h2><p>If the model already contains a View it will be visible in the &quot;Views&quot; folder in the Model Tree:</p><p>The Default View in the Model Tree</p><p>To open and edit the View, double-click it in the Model Tree (or press Ctrl-Shift-O / Command-Shift-O). The View Editor will open showing the editing canvas and palette:</p><p>The View Editor showing a blank drawing canvas and palette</p><p>Creating a New View</p><p>An ArchiMate model usually consists of more than one View. To add a new View to the model, right-click on the &quot;Views&quot; folder in the Model Tree and select &quot;New-&gt;ArchiMate View&quot; from the context menu:</p><p>Adding a new View to a Model</p><p>Once the View has been added to the model it can be opened from the tree by double- clicking on it. Any number of Views can be added to a model and be open at the same time. Views are arranged in tabs in the main editing area of the application window.</p><p>Working with Views</p><p>Once a View has been opened you may now &quot;draw&quot; on the canvas, adding and creating new ArchiMate elements, connections (relationships) and annotations (notes). As you add figures to the canvas from the palette, the corresponding ArchiMate elements and relationships are added to the ArchiMate model and are visible in the Model Tree.</p><p>You also add existing concepts to the View by dragging and dropping them from the Model Tree into the View. You can add new elements to the Model Tree (see Adding Elements Directly to the Model Tree) and then drag them to any number of Views in the model. Thus, elements and relations can appear in more than one View, each occurrence referencing the same concept in the Model. Thus, if you change the name of the model concept it will change for all occurrences in all Views.</p><p>Navigating a View</p><p>Panning</p><p>If you select the first selection tool from the Palette, click somewhere on the View to give it the focus and then hold the Space bar down the cursor will change to a hand and you can pan the View. You can also pan around the View by holding down the middle mouse button.</p><p>Using the Keyboard Instead of the Mouse in a View</p><p>It is possible to move and resize selected objects in a View by using the computer keyboard instead of a mouse. To move an object, press the period key (&quot;.&quot;) once to reveal the MOVE cursor. Then use the Arrow keys, followed by the ENTER key to commit the move. To resize the object, press the period key (&quot;.&quot;) until the RESIZE cursor appears at the desired resize handle. Press the ENTER key to commit the resize.</p><p>Automatic Scrolling in a View</p><p>Sometimes you may find that a concept is outside the area of the View area and you wish to draw a new connection between one concept and another concept outside of the View area (the scrollbars would normally need to be used). To do so, simply click on the source concept after selecting the connection tool and then hover the mouse at the edge of the Viewport. After a short pause, the View will automatically scroll.</p><p>Zooming a View</p><p>You can zoom in and out of a View in a number of different ways:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>- From the main &quot;View&quot; menu\n</code></pre></div><div class="language-"><pre><code>- By using the shortcut key combinations Ctrl +, Ctrl =, Ctrl - and Ctrl 0\n(&quot;Command&quot; key on Mac)\n- By using the Zoom combo box on the main toolbar.\n- By holding the Ctrl key down (&quot;Command&quot; key on Mac) and using the mouse\nscroll wheel\n</code></pre></div><p>Used in combination with the Outline View you can easily navigate around large diagrams.</p><p>Find and Replace</p><p>It is also possible to find and replace concepts in a View by name.</p><p>Find and Replace dialog</p><p>The Palette</p><p>The palette contains the drawing tools, and elements and relationships that can be added to a View. It is an area that is attached to a View.</p><p>The Palette in a View</p><p>To create new elements and relationships in a View select the required object tool on the palette and either click or drag it onto the canvas area. Once the figure has been added to the canvas you can resize and re-position it by the usual drag actions.</p><p>You can configure how the Palette displays items by right-clicking on the Palette and choosing &quot;Settings...&quot;:</p><p>Palette Settings</p><p>If you cannot see the palette in a View it may be closed. If this is the case, open it by clicking the &quot;Show Palette&quot; triangle button at the top-right of the View window.</p><p>The Detached Palette</p><p>By default, each View has its own attached Palette. It is also possible to have a single, detachable Palette that you can drag and dock to any position in the application window. To do this, click on the &quot;Palette&quot; button on the main toolbar:</p><p>The &quot;Palette&quot; button on the main toolbar</p><p>Pressing this button detaches the Palette from the View and creates a Palette window. You can drag and dock this to anywhere in the application space. The following example has the Palette docked in the lower left corner:</p><p>The Palette window docked in the lower left corner</p><p>Closing the Palette window re-attaches it to any open Views.</p><p>Palette Selection Tools</p><p>There are two selection tools available in the Palette. These are used to select the objects in a diagram in various ways.</p><p>The selection tools in the Palette</p><p>The first tool (selection tool) is primarily used to select elements (boxes). When dragging a marquee area around elements and connections with this tool, only the elements (boxes) will be selected.</p><p>The second tool (marquee tool) is activated by a drop-down button and is used to select both elements and connections in various ways:</p><p>The selection tool options</p><p>You can add elements or connections to a selection with the selection tool by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking on the element or connection. The same operation can be used to remove an element or connection from a selection.</p><p>When several elements or connections are selected, one will be marked with dark handles. This is called the primary selection.</p><p>Three elements selected, topmost is the primary selection</p><p>The primary selection is used with the alignment tools. You can change which element or connection is the primary selection with the selection tool by holding down the Shift key and clicking the element or connection you wish to make the primary selection.</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Tip: Pan the View using the selection tool.\nIf you select the first selection tool from the Palette, click somewhere on the\nView to give it the focus and then hold the Space bar down the cursor will\nchange to a hand and you can pan the View. You can also pan around the\nView using the middle mouse button.\n</code></pre></div><p>Palette Creation Tools</p><p>Apart from the Selection Tools there are other tools available on the Palette used to create new ArchiMate concepts, Notes, Groups and Relations between concepts (connections). To add a new element to the canvas select one and drag it onto or click onto the canvas.</p><p>Relations</p><p>There are several types of ArchiMate relation and a Junction element.</p><p>The Relations Creation Tools in the Palette</p><p>The first tool is the Magic Connector, used for drawing connections. This is followed by creation tools for ArchiMate relations and a Junction element.</p><p>Notes and Groups</p><p>Used for adding a Note, Group Container, or a Note Connection to a View.</p><p>Note, Group and Note Connection Creation Tools</p><p>ArchiMate Elements</p><p>These are divided into areas corresponding to the &quot;Other&quot;, Business&quot;, &quot;Application&quot;, &quot;Technology&quot;, &quot;Physical&quot;, &quot;Motivation&quot;, and &quot;Implementation &amp; Migration&quot; ArchiMate concept groupings:</p><p>The ArchiMate Element Creation tools</p><p>Note that a sub-set of these elements will only be available if the current View is restricted to a given Viewpoint.</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Tip: Press the shift key when selecting a palette tool to keep it\nselected.\nBy default, once an element or connection has been drawn on the canvas\nthe default selection tool (arrow) is re-selected on the palette. If you wish to\nkeep the current palette tool selected hold the &quot;Shift&quot; key down when you\nselect it.\n</code></pre></div><p>The Format Painter</p><p>The Format Painter is a tool on the Palette toolbar that allows you to quickly copy the visual formatting of one object and paste it to others in a View. Instead of having to manually apply the font, font colour, text alignment, and other formatting to each new object in a View, you can quickly copy all of the formatting attributes by using one toolbar button.</p><p>The Format Painter tool is at the top of the Palette:</p><p>The Format Painter tool</p><p>To copy and paste formatting in View:</p><ol><li>Select the Format Painter tool from the Palette. Initially it will appear grey, indicating that it is &quot;empty&quot; and ready to copy.</li><li>Click on the source object or connection from which you wish to copy the formatting. The Format Painter tool cursor will change to a darker outline and to the colour of the fill object or connection that is copied. Also, the tool entry on the Palette will appear darker and the tooltip will update to explain this.</li><li>Now click on the target objects or connections to paste the formatting.</li><li>To clear the Format Painter so it is ready to copy some more formatting, either double-click on the tool in the Palette or double-click on an empty space on the canvas.</li></ol><p>Note that some formatting cannot be copied and pasted from an object to a connection, and vice-versa. You can use the Format Painter tool between different Views. If it is &quot;primed&quot;, simply select it from the Palette in another View and paste the formatting to target objects or connections.</p><p>Adding New Elements to the View from the Palette</p><p>To create and add new elements to the View select the required element on the Palette and either click or drag the new figure onto the canvas area. Once the figure has been added to the canvas you can resize and re-position it by the usual drag actions.</p><p>Adding Elements to the View Automatically Adds them to the Model Tree</p><p>It is important to understand that adding elements (and relationships) to a View from the palette automatically adds those elements to the Model Tree as well. For example, dragging a &quot;Business Actor&quot; element onto the canvas creates both a figure on the View called &quot;Business Actor&quot; and also a node on the Model Tree with the same name.</p><p>Furthermore, if you delete an element in a View the corresponding element in the Model Tree is not deleted. This is because the element may be referenced in another View in the model. To delete the element completely you have to delete it in the Model Tree or choose the right-click menu item, &quot;Delete from Model&quot;.</p><p>You can edit the element&#39;s name directly by clicking the text area on a figure. Double- clicking on the figure opens the Properties Window where you may edit the properties of the selected element.</p><p>Editing the View&#39;s Elements&#39; Properties</p><p>The properties for a selected element in a View can be edited in the Properties Window. To open the Properties Window, either double-click the figure or select the figure and open the window from the toolbar or main menu. Each element in the View has different properties that can be set or viewed in the Properties Window. For more information see the section, The Properties Window.</p><p>Double-clicking an Element in a View opens the Properties Window, single-clicking on an already selected Element&#39;s text field allows you to directly edit the Element&#39;s text.</p><p>Adding New Relationships (Connections) to the View from</p><p>the Palette</p><p>To add new relationships (connections) to the View select the required connection tool on the Palette and drag from one element on the View to another on the same View.</p><p>As with adding elements from the palette, adding a relationship to a View automatically adds it to the Model Tree as well, in the &quot;Relations&quot; folder.</p><p>When adding a new connection in a View, if the same type of model relationship already exists between the source and target elements, a dialog box will appear giving you the option to reference that model relationship from the connection, or create a new connection and model relationship:</p><p>A dialog providing the option of re-using a model relationship.</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Relationships, Rules and Regulations.\nArchiMate elements can connect to other elements by a given set of\nrelationships (connections). Some relationships are allowed, others are not.\nIf a relationship is not allowed the cursor will show as a &quot;Not Allowed&quot;\nsymbol, a circle with a diagonal line. If a relationship is allowed, it will show\nas a &quot;plug&quot; symbol.\n</code></pre></div><p>Information about Connections</p><p>Once a relationship (connection) has been created between elements, some useful information can be revealed when the mouse cursor hovers over the connection to reveal a tooltip. The tooltip displays the relationship&#39;s name, its type, and some text that describes the nature of the relationship between the source and target elements.</p><p>A tooltip shows useful information when hovering over a connection</p><p>Adding Circular Relationships (Connections)</p><p>You may add a circular relationship (connection) if you wish. This is a relationship whose target and source element is the same. You can create a connection from an element to itself by selecting the required relationship from the Palette, clicking once on the element and then clicking again on the element:</p><p>A circular relationship</p><p>Adding New Relationships and Elements to the View using</p><p>the Magic Connector</p><p>Connecting one element to another in a View depends on whether the relationship is allowed according to the ArchiMate specification. For example, you cannot connect an Assignment relationship from an Application Component to a Business Actor. Unless you are very familiar with the rules governing the relationships in ArchiMate it can be frustrating to find the allowable relationships between one element and another. The &quot;Magic Connector&quot; solves this problem.</p><p>The Magic Connector in the Palette</p><p>The Magic Connector has two uses - firstly to create a new allowed connection between one element and another, and secondly to create a new element and an allowed connection between the source element and the newly created element.</p><p>To create a connection between a source and a target element using the Magic Connector follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Select the Magic Connector tool from the palette</li><li>Click on the source element in the View</li><li>Click on the target element in the View</li><li>A popup menu will appear showing the allowable relationships between the two elements. Choose the required type from the menu. It is possible to create a relationship from the source to the target element, and also in reverse from the target to the source element. Both directional options are separated in the popup menu.</li></ol><p>Drawing a connection using the Magic Connector</p><p>To create a new element and connection in one operation using the Magic Connector follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Select the Magic Connector tool from the palette</li><li>Click on the source element</li><li>Click on a blank area of the View&#39;s canvas, or on a Group figure</li><li>A cascading popup menu will appear showing all allowable elements and relationships between the two. Choose the required element and connection from the menu</li></ol><p>In the following example a new Business Role element will be created together with a new Assignment relationship connecting to the original selected Business Actor element.</p><p>Using the Magic Connector to create a new element and connection</p><p>If you hold down the Ctrl key (or the Command key on Mac) at the same time as clicking on a blank area of the canvas then the Elements will be shown first followed by the Connections in the popup menus (this behaviour can be reversed in Preferences):</p><p>Using the Magic Connector to create a new element and connection while pressing the Ctrl / Command key</p><p>Adding Elements and Relations from the Model Tree to a</p><p>View</p><p>Existing elements and relationships can be added to a View by dragging and dropping them from the Model Tree to a View.</p><p>Dragging and dropping a relationship into a View also adds its source and target elements to the View if they are not already present on the View. Any existing elements on the View automatically have all their connections to the dropped element(s) added as well.</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>When you drag and drop elements from the Model Tree to a View any\nassociated relationships are also added to the view as connections. There\nmay be times when you do not want this to happen, you may simply wish to\ndrag another instance of an element onto the View, for example. In order to\ndo this, on Windows and Linux hold the Ctrl key down, or on Mac hold the Alt\nkey down when dragging and dropping.\n</code></pre></div><p>Working this way means that you can regard the Model Tree as a repository of elements and relations for the model that can be added to any View within the same model. The same element can be added more than once to a View.</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Important! - A model element or relationship can appear multiple times in\nthe same or different Views. You can set its visual appearance individually\nfor each occurrence.\n</code></pre></div><p>Adding a Group</p><p>Elements can be grouped together in a View using a Group container type. Note that this is not the same as an ArchiMate Grouping Element, and that it has no semantic meaning other than being a visual collection of elements.</p><p>A Group can be added from the View&#39;s Palette:</p><p>The Group Palette Entry</p><p>The following example shows elements grouped together using the Group element to indicate the various layers in the model:</p><p>Example of Groups</p><p>A Group&#39;s name, font and fill colour can be edited in the Properties Window.</p><p>Double-clicking a Group opens the Properties Window, clicking on the Group&#39;s text field allows you to directly edit the Group&#39;s text.</p><p>Adding a Note</p><p>Notes can be added to the View to allow for visual annotations. A note has no semantic meaning in the ArchiMate language.</p><p>A Note can be added from the View&#39;s Palette:</p><p>The Note Palette entry</p><p>The following example shows elements annotated with a Note:</p><p>Using a Note in a View</p><p>A Note&#39;s text, font and fill colour can be edited in the Properties Window.</p><p>Double-clicking the Note opens the Properties Window, clicking on a selected Note allows you to directly edit the Note&#39;s text.</p><p>Adding a Note Connection</p><p>You can draw a connecting line from and to a Note using the &quot;Note Connection&quot; line tool in the Palette. It has no semantic meaning like the other ArchiMate relationship types. Double-clicking the Note Connection opens the Properties Window.</p><p>Adding a Junction</p><p>A Junction element can be added from the View&#39;s palette in the Relations palette section:</p><p>The Junction entry in the Palette</p><p>A junction is used in a number of situations to connect relationships of the same type. A junction may have multiple incoming relationships and one outgoing relationship, one incoming relationship and multiple outgoing relationships, or multiple incoming and outgoing relationships (the latter can be considered a shorthand of two subsequent junctions).</p><p>There are two types of Junction - &quot;And&quot; and &quot;Or&quot;. The type of Junction can be set in the Properties window:</p><p>Setting the type of Junction</p><p>Junctions appear in the Model tree in the &quot;Other&quot; folder. They can also be added directly to the Model Tree by right-clicking on the &quot;Other&quot; folder and selecting the &quot;New&quot; menu item.</p><p>Example of an &quot;Or&quot; type Junction</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Note that Archi does not currently enforce the full ArchiMate rules when\nconnecting junctions. You should ensure that only relationships of the same\n</code></pre></div><div class="language-"><pre><code>type are used to connect concepts and junctions. You can check for\nconsistency by using the Validator.\n</code></pre></div><p>Adding a Reference to Another View</p><p>A View Reference figure acts as a link to another View from within a View. It&#39;s a shortcut that when double-clicked opens the linked View.</p><p>To add a View Reference drag a View node from the Tree Model onto the canvas of the target View. Note that you cannot reference the same View from itself. The following screenshot shows how the user has created a &quot;Map&quot; View with View References to all the other Views in the model:</p><p>Adding View References to create a &quot;Map&quot; View</p><p>The font and fill colour of the View Reference figure can be set in the Properties Window.</p><p>Connection Bend-points</p><p>A connection line (relationship) can have any number of bend-points so that the connection can be routed to form bends and deviations in the diagram.</p><p>To add a bend-point to a connection firstly select the connection. A bend-point &quot;handle&quot;, or dot, will appear in the middle of the connection:</p><p>A connection bend-point &quot;handle&quot;</p><p>Drag the bend-point handle in the desired direction. Notice that as you drag the handle two new bend-point handles are added to the connection:</p><p>Connection bend-point &quot;handles&quot; appear</p><p>You can continue to select and drag these handles to create new bend-points. As each new bend-point is created, two new handles will appear either side of the selected handle.</p><p>To delete a bend-point, select the bend-point&#39;s handle and drag it so that the connection line becomes straight. Once the connection line is straightened the bend-point will disappear.</p><p>Bend points snap to grid if &quot;Snap to Grid&quot; is turned on in the &quot;View&quot; menu. If you need finer control over placing the bend-point you can over-ride this by holding down the Alt key on Windows, Alt/Shift on Linux, or the Ctrl key on Mac.</p><p>Note - bend-points cannot be added to connections if the Connection Router Type for the View is set to &quot;Manhattan&quot;. See here for more details.</p><p>Setting the Properties of a Connection</p><p>A Connection&#39;s (Relationship&#39;s) properties can be edited by selecting the connection on the View and opening the Properties Window. See the section, Relationship Connection Appearance Properties, for more information.</p><p>Text can be added to a connection (on the &quot;Main&quot; tab) and displayed in one of three positions, and the thickness of the line itself can be set as can the text&#39;s font and colour. The following screenshot shows a connection with a medium line width and text showing in the &quot;Target&quot; position with a blue italic font and purple line colour:</p><p>Setting a Connection&#39;s Text, Position, Line Width, Font, Font and Line Colour</p><p>Setting the Connection Router Type for a View</p><p>By default, connections are drawn as straight lines from object to object. Bend-points can be added to a connection as detailed here. However, it is possible to set the overall connection router type so that the connections route around objects or are drawn orthogonally.</p><p>The connection router type can be set either from the main &quot;View-&gt;Connection Router&quot; menu or by right-clicking on a View or from the &quot;Appearance&quot; tab in the Properties Window when the View canvas is selected.</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Apart from the view specific settings, the global setting Use orthogonal\nconnection anchors from the Connection Preferences tab can be used to\nchange the way connections are drawn.\n</code></pre></div><p>The available router types are as follows:</p><p>Manual</p><p>Connections are drawn in straight lines. Bend-points can be added by the user.</p><p>Manual Router</p><p>Manhattan</p><p>Connections are routed orthogonally. Bend-points cannot be added by the user.</p><p>Manhattan Router</p><p>Container Elements and Nested Element Relationships</p><p>Each graphical element (except for notes and junctions) can act as a container element for other elements. Dragging and dropping an element inside of another element means that it becomes a child of the parent element. This is useful to represent containment type relationships such as Composition, Aggregation, and Association or for convenient grouping.</p><p>In the following screenshot the elements &quot;Register&quot;, &quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;Valuate&quot; and &quot;Pay&quot; are child elements of the parent &quot;Handle Claim Process&quot; element:</p><p>Child elements contained by a parent element</p><p>While dragging elements into or over other elements a visual cue is provided to indicate that the dragged element will be moved into the parent (container) element. This is a blue highlight around the target element as the element is dragged over it:</p><p>A Child Element being Dragged into a Container Element. The Container highlighted in blue</p><p>Creating, Showing and Hiding Relationships between</p><p>Nested Parent/Child Elements</p><p>The ArchiMate specification states that some relationships may also be expressed by nesting the model elements. That is to say, an explicit connection need not be drawn between the parent and child elements but that it may be represented as a container nesting of elements.</p><p>Archi supports this convention with Automatic Relationship Management (ARM). This system ensures that relationships are automatically created and hidden between qualifying parent/child elements. The system can be configured to suit the user&#39;s needs. See Preferences to configure the ARM.</p><p>The best way to explain the Automatic Relationship Management system (ARM) is by an example.</p><p>Example - Nested sub-processes in a Composite relationship</p><p>Suppose the user has a Business Process element named &quot;Handle Claim Process&quot; that will act as a container element (&quot;parent&quot;) for four sub-processes, &quot;Register&quot;, &quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;Valuate&quot; and &quot;Pay&quot;. The relationship between the parent process and the sub- processes would normally be expressed as four Composition relationships. These can be drawn conventionally using connecting lines as follows:</p><p>Composition relationship between parent and child processes</p><p>However, this is visually not as clear as if the sub-processes were placed inside of the container parent process.</p><p>We can solve this problem by enabling the ARM system in Preferences. This ensures that when the sub-processes are placed in the parent element the connections are hidden in the View, but are still present in the actual semantic model. Dragging the child elements in and out of the parent element hides and shows the explicit relationships. The hidden connections are &quot;implicit&quot; connections.</p><p>The Connections now hidden from the View</p><p>Adding new elements to a parent element</p><p>Adding new elements to a parent element in a View from the Palette or dragging and dropping from the Model Tree results in a dialog box asking if a new relationship should be created between the parent and child elements:</p><p>Dialog to create a new nested relationship</p><p>Note that the dialog will only display valid relationships between the parent and child elements, and only those that are specified in Preferences. Valid relations between the child and parent elements can also be selected. These are shown as &quot;(reverse)&quot;.</p><p>If you do not wish to create a new relationship, select &quot;None&quot;.</p><p>Moving existing elements to a parent element</p><p>If more than one element is moved (drag and drop operation) to a parent element in a View or is dragged and dropped from the Model Tree onto a parent element, and there are no existing preferred relationships between the parent and the child elements then a dialog box is displayed offering to create new relationships between the parent element and the child elements. You can choose a different type of relationship for each child element:</p><p>Dialog for creating more than one relationship</p><p>If you do not wish to create a new relationship for an element, select &quot;(none)&quot; from the drop-down combo box. To select the same type of relationship in the drop-down combo- box, hold down the Ctrl / Command key and select.</p><p>Setting the Order of Overlapping Elements</p><p>Overlapping elements in a View can be brought to the front or back, or brought forward or sent back. This is also known as the &quot;Z&quot; order. This is achieved by selecting the element in a View and right-clicking to invoke the &quot;Order&quot; menu items. These same menu items are also available from the main &quot;View&quot; menu.</p><p>Changing the order of overlapping elements</p><p>Selecting Elements in a View</p><p>Diagram elements and connections may be selected in the view by clicking on them with the selection tool or the marquee tool. For more information about these tools see Palette Selection Tools.</p><p>Copying and Pasting Elements in a View</p><p>Diagram elements may be cut, copied and pasted in Views. There are, however, certain constraints on how this works:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>- If an element is pasted into a View from the same model where the element\nalready exists in that View then a new model element and a new diagram\nelement are created for the View. The new element is a copy of the original. Any\nconnections are also newly created as copies.\n- If an element is pasted in a View from the same model where the element does\nnot already exist then a new diagram element is created for the View and the\noriginal model element is referenced. This is equivalent to dragging the element\nfrom the Model Tree into the View. Any connections are also referenced.\n</code></pre></div><p>If an element is pasted into a View from a different model then a new model element and a new diagram element are created for the View. The new element is a copy of the original. Any connections are also newly created as copies.</p><p>If you choose the &quot;Paste Special&quot; menu option, instead of &quot;Paste&quot; then you can change this behaviour such that references to copied elements are created rather than new elements. You can set the behaviour for this feature in Preferences.</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>If you copy some diagram elements and then click on the View before\npasting, the copied elements will be pasted at the point where you clicked.\n</code></pre></div><p>Copy As Image to Clipboard</p><p>A View (diagram) can be copied as an image to the system clipboard. This is available from the &quot;Copy As Image To Clipboard&quot; menu command from the main &quot;Edit&quot; menu or by right-clicking on a View and selecting the menu item from the contextual menu. This menu command is only available if a View is open and selected. The shortcut key combination is Ctrl-Shift-C (Command key on Mac). Once the View is copied to the system clipboard it can be pasted into other applications such as word processing and drawing tools.</p><p>Deleting Elements and Relationships (Connections) in a</p><p>View</p><p>Selected elements and/or connections in a View can be deleted from the View by choosing the &quot;Delete from View&quot; menu item from the main &quot;Edit&quot; menu, from the main toolbar or from the right-click menu. Note - this action deletes those elements from the View not from the model. To delete the element completely you have to delete it in the Model Tree or select &quot;Delete from Model&quot;.</p><p>Select in Model Tree</p><p>This menu item is available when right-clicking an element or relationship in a View. It will select the corresponding model element in the Model Tree.</p><p>Delete from Model</p><p>This menu item is available when right-clicking an element or relationship in a View. The selected elements and/or relationships are then deleted from the model itself and any Views that reference those elements. This is the equivalent of selecting the elements in the Model Tree and choosing &quot;Delete&quot;.</p><p>Alignment Tools, Guides and the Grid</p><p>In order to facilitate the drawing of pleasing diagrams, various alignment tools are provided. These are available from the main &quot;View-&gt;Position&quot; menu item, from the main toolbar or by right-clicking on the diagram&#39;s canvas area to select the &quot;Position&quot; menu items. These are as follows:</p><p>Zoom in / Zoom out / Actual Size:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Zoom in and out of the diagram. This is also available on the\ntoolbar as a combo box. You can also Zoom in and out by holding\nthe Ctrl key and scrolling the mouse wheel.\n</code></pre></div><p>Snap to Grid: Snaps elements to the Grid whether it is visible or not. (Grid spacing can be set in Preferences.)</p><p>Grid Visible: Toggles the visibility of the Grid. (Grid spacing can be set in Preferences.)</p><p>Snap to Alignment Guides:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>These are blue alignment guides (lines) that appear when\nelements are dragged in a diagram. They assist in lining the edges\nand centres of elements.\n</code></pre></div><p>Align Left: When two or more elements are selected align on the left edge of the primary selection.</p><p>Align Center: (^) When two or more elements are selected align centrally horizontally to the primary selection. Align Right: When two or more elements are selected align on the right edge of the primary selection. Align Top: When two or more elements are selected align on the top edge of the primary selection. Align Middle: When two or more elements are selected align centrally vertically to the primary selection. Align Bottom: When two or more elements are selected align on the bottom edge of the primary selection. Match Width: (^) When two or more elements are selected match the width of the elements to the primary selection. Match Height: When two or more elements are selected match the height of the elements to the primary selection. Default Size: Set the selected element to its default size. If disabled then the element is already set to its default size.</p><p>For information about the primary selection see Palette Selection Tools.</p><p>Showing a View in Full Screen Mode</p><p>On Windows and Linux, a View can be displayed and edited in Full Screen mode (this is not available on the Mac OS X version of Archi since OS X has its own full screen support). This can be useful to maximise the View for presentation purposes. To do so select a View and press the F11 key, or choose the &quot;Full Screen&quot; menu item from the main &quot;View&quot; menu. The View will be maximised:</p><p>A View in Full Screen mode</p><p>The Floating Palette window can be closed with the Escape key or the window&#39;s close button. Right-clicking on the View in Full Screen mode invokes a context menu where the Palette may be shown if it is not currently visible.</p><p>Export View As Image</p><p>A View (diagram) can be exported as an image file to disk. This is available from the &quot;Export View As Image...&quot; menu command from the main &quot;File-&gt;Export&quot; menu or by right-clicking on a View and selecting the menu item from the contextual menu. This menu command is only available if a View is open and selected.</p><p>Available formats are BMP, JPG, PNG, PDF and SVG. The first three formats can be exported at scaled ranging from 25% to 400%. SVG format has more options including embedding font information and setting the viewBox bounds for different scales.</p><p>Exporting a View as an image</p><h1 id="viewpoints"><a class="header-anchor" href="#viewpoints" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Viewpoints</h1><p>The ArchiMate Specification states that &quot;Viewpoints are a means to focus on particular aspects and layers of the architecture. These aspects and layers are determined by the concerns of a stakeholder with whom communication takes place. What should and should not be visible from a specific viewpoint is therefore entirely dependent on the argumentation with respect to a stakeholder&#39;s concerns.&quot;</p><p>In practice, a Viewpoint is a sub-set of elements and relationships aimed at a stakeholder. Archi allows you to specify the following Viewpoints:</p><p>Supported Viewpoints</p><p>When creating a new View in Archi, the default Viewpoint is set to &quot;None&quot;, meaning that all concepts can be added to the View. Setting a Viewpoint on a View means that a sub- set of elements is available to place on the View. Some other ArchiMate authoring tools require you to specify the Viewpoint in advance when creating the View. Unfortunately, this means that you cannot change your mind should you wish to later change the Viewpoint in the View. Archi, however, implements Dynamic Viewpoints so that you can change the Viewpoint at any time and those elements that are not permitted for that Viewpoint are &quot;ghosted&quot; out. Dynamic Viewpoints allow you to change your mind. You don&#39;t have to decide up-front what the Viewpoint will be. You can experiment with different Viewpoints for the same View. And if you decide to keep the Viewpoint, you can simply remove any disallowed elements from the View.</p><p>Setting the Viewpoint</p><p>To set the Viewpoint for a View, open the View in the View editor and select the required Viewpoint from the main &quot;View-&gt;Viewpoint&quot; menu, or by right-clicking on the View&#39;s drawing area and selecting it from the context menu. You can also change the Viewpoint from the View&#39;s Properties window.</p><p>In the following example we start with a View that has the default &quot;None&quot; Viewpoint:</p><p>A View with the &quot;None&quot; Viewpoint</p><p>Notice that all elements from all the ArchiMate layers (Business, Application, and Technology) are displayed. Also, the Palette has all elements available.</p><p>If we now change the Viewpoint to &quot;Infrastructure&quot; then any elements that do not belong in this Viewpoint are &quot;ghosted&quot; out in the View. Notice, also, that only the elements permitted for the current Viewpoint are available in the Palette, whilst the others are not available:</p><p>The same View with the &quot;Technology Usage&quot; Viewpoint</p><p>If we look at the elements in the Model Tree we can see that non-permitted elements for the Viewpoint are also greyed out:</p><p>Elements not permitted for the Viewpoint are greyed out</p><p>If we choose to, we can drag and drop any element from the Model Tree to the View but the resulting element in the View will be greyed out. This means that we can work with the Viewpoint any way we want to but we are reminded at all times of what should and shouldn&#39;t be added to the Viewpoint.</p><p>If you are unsure of the constraints for a Viewpoint select it then open the Hints Window.

Some properties (for example, the name) are shared between a concept in the Model Tree and its counterpart in a View. Some properties are only relevant for an object in a View (fill colour and font, for example).</p><p>To edit the Properties for selected objects in the Model Tree or in a View, select the object(s) and open the Properties Window either by double-clicking the tree node or View object, or from the main &quot;Window&quot; menu or main toolbar.</p><p>If selected, the local menu option in the drop-down menu, &quot;Single Column Layout&quot;, will show some controls in the Appearance tab in a single column.</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Note - some properties are only available when the object is selected in\na View (for example, fill colour or line width).\n</code></pre></div><h2 id="model-properties"><a class="header-anchor" href="#model-properties" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Model Properties</h2><p>Selecting the top level node for a model in the Model Tree means that you can edit or view the following properties in the Properties Window.</p><p>The Main Tab</p><p>Editing the &quot;Main&quot; Properties for an ArchiMate model</p><p>Name: The name of the ArchiMate model</p><p>File: The file name of the model (read-only)</p><p>Purpose: A space to enter a description of the purpose of the model</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>In the &quot;Purpose&quot; text control, URLs that start with &quot;http://&quot; &quot;https://&quot; or\n&quot;ftp://&quot; will show as a hyperlink.

It is used to display and allow navigation between connected concepts via their relationships and is used in conjunction with the Model Tree window and Views.</p><p>The Model Tree acts as a &quot;flat&quot; repository for all the elements, relationships and Views in a model. Views are graphical configurations of those concepts. However, the Navigator is able to show all of a concept&#39;s relationships at the model level regardless of how they are presented in a View.</p><p>To use the Navigator window, select any element or relationship in the Model Tree or in a View. The Navigator tree will update to reflect the current selection. The tree shows the &quot;root&quot; selected concept and any relationships that stem from it and any &quot;target&quot; concepts from those relationships:</p><p>The Navigator Window</p><p>In the above screenshot the user has selected the element &quot;CRM System&quot;. There are three Realisation relationships between the selected element and the three elements &quot;Customer Administration Service&quot;, &quot;Insurance Application Service&quot;, and &quot;CIS&quot;. From these three elements further relationships are shown between them and their target concepts.</p><p>It is possible, therefore, to &quot;drill down&quot; into the Navigator tree and traverse from concept to concept following it and its child relationships from source to target.</p><p>A selected sub-concept can become the &quot;root&quot; concept by either double-clicking on it in the tree or by clicking on the &quot;Go Into&quot; button on the window&#39;s toolbar:</p><p>The &quot;Go Into&quot; Button</p><p>Conversely, pressing the &quot;Back&quot; button takes you back to the previously selected concept:</p><p>The &quot;Back&quot; button</p><p>The &quot;Home&quot; button takes you back to the main root concept that was originally selected:</p><p>The &quot;Home&quot; button</p><p>By default, the Navigator shows relationships that flow from the source to the target concept. It is possible to reverse this to show the concept&#39;s relations that flow from the target to the source by clicking on the &quot;Show source relations&quot; button on the window&#39;s toolbar:</p><p>Show source relations mode</p><p>In the above screenshot the element &quot;CRM System&quot; is the target of the two &quot;Used By&quot; relationships.

The data is exported in three different files - &quot;elements.csv&quot;, &quot;relations.csv&quot; and &quot;properties.csv&quot;. All data objects are identified by unique identifiers so that a property will reference an element or relation in the other files.</p><p>This option is available from the &quot;Export Model To CSV...&quot; menu item from the main &quot;File-&gt;Export&quot; menu. Once a model is selected in the Model Tree or in a View this menu item is enabled.</p><p>Exporting the model to CSV</p><p>The CSV field format for elements is - &quot;ID&quot;, &quot;Type&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Documentation&quot;</p><p>The CSV field format for relations is - &quot;ID&quot;,&quot;Type&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Documentation&quot;, &quot;Source&quot;, &quot;Target&quot;</p><p>The CSV field format for properties is - &quot;ID&quot;, &quot;Key&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;</p><h2 id="export-options"><a class="header-anchor" href="#export-options" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Export Options</h2><p>Output Folder Select the folder for the output files.</p><p>Delimiter Select the CSV field delimiter character - comma, semicolon, or tab.</p><p>File prefix Provide an optional prefix to add to the file names. For example, &quot;MyModel-&quot; will change the file names to &quot;MyModel-elements.csv&quot;, &quot;MyModel-relations.csv&quot;, and &quot;MyModel- properties.csv&quot;.</p><p>File encoding Select the file encoding to use - ANSI, UTF-8 or UTF-8 BOM. Some programs prefer one or the other file encoding. For example, MS Excel prefers the &quot;UTF- 8 BOM&quot; encoding if Unicode characters are present in the CSV file.</p><p>Strip newline characters If selected will remove all newline characters from multi-line text such as documentation.</p><p>Excel compatible If selected will surround text starting with a zero or space with quote marks so that the data imports correctly into Excel. Also, any text field that starts with a &quot;=&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, or &quot;@&quot; character will be prefixed with a space so that Excel does not interpret it as a formula.</p><p>Importing CSV Data into a Model</p><p>You can also import CSV data into an existing model. The CSV files need to be in the same format as described above. Element and relationship IDs are optional, but you need to provide an ID for an element or relationship if it is referenced by another concept or property. If providing an ID then it needs to be unique to the file using alpha-numeric characters, for example - &quot;id1&quot;, &quot;8fe456d&quot;, &quot;actor3&quot;. If an ID is not provided, a blank field &quot;&quot; should be present. In this case, an ID will be generated on import.</p><p>When importing CSV data into an existing model you can provide just one or all three files (elements, relations, properties). Usually you will provide all three files. The format of the files is as follows:</p><p>&quot;xxx-elements.csv&quot; &quot;xxx-relations.csv&quot; &quot;xxx-properties.csv&quot;</p><p>The prefix (&quot;xxx&quot;) is optional but must be the same for all three files if used. All three file names need to match - for example: &quot;myname-elements.csv&quot;, &quot;myname-relations.csv&quot; and &quot;myname-properties.csv&quot;. At the very least, the filenames need to contain the &quot;.csv&quot; extension and the names end with &quot;elements&quot;, &quot;relations&quot; or &quot;properties&quot;.</p><p>The best way to understand the required format is to export an existing model to CSV format, and open the resulting files in a text editor, or spreadsheet application</p><p>When importing the CSV file(s) into Archi you can select any of the three CSV files in the Import dialog box. If there are corresponding &quot;*.csv&quot; files then these file(s) will be automatically imported at the same time.</p><p>It is also possible to merge/update the imported CSV data into an existing model. If a model concept already exists as denoted by its ID, and the CSV row entry contains different data to that in the model it is updated. For example, a Business Actor with id &quot;9240f5bf&quot;, named &quot;BA1&quot;, and no documentation can be updated with a row entry as follows:</p><p>&quot;ID&quot;,&quot;Type&quot;,&quot;Name&quot;,&quot;Documentation&quot; &quot;9240f5bf&quot;,&quot;BusinessActor&quot;,&quot;New Name&quot;,&quot;Additional Documentation&quot;</p><p>You can import just one or two CSV files into an existing model. If you import just an &quot;elements.csv&quot; file then only elements will be imported. If you then import a &quot;relations.csv&quot; file that uses the corresponding concept IDs you can import just the relations. The same is true for the &quot;properties.csv&quot; file.</p><p>If you are manually creating CSV files make sure you save them using UTF-8 format to preserve all special characters.</p><p>Note - it is currently not possible to import and export View diagram information in CSV format.</p><h1 id="importing-another-model-into-the-current-model"><a class="header-anchor" href="#importing-another-model-into-the-current-model" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Importing Another Model into the Current Model</h1><p>It is possible to import and merge another Archi model into the currently selected model.

The scope of the standard is restricted to the elements and the relationships of an ArchiMate model. It excludes features that are vendor- specific, although addresses how these can be accommodated. The exchange file format contains basic model information including:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>- Objects of all ArchiMate types with basic attributes\n- Relationship details between objects\n- Diagrammatic information (Phase 2)\n</code></pre></div><p>The exchange file format is not intended as a persistent file format for the model itself, it is a mechanism to convey instance data from one tool to another. The data contained in the exchange file format is meant to be processed by an &quot;ArchiMate aware&quot; tool, thus ruling out standalone semantic inference. Once the instance data has been imported into an ArchiMate tool, that tool will probably save it in its own proprietary file format.</p><h2 id="exporting-and-settings"><a class="header-anchor" href="#exporting-and-settings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Exporting and Settings</h2><p>To export an Archi model to an Open Exchange Format file, select the menu item &quot;File-</p><blockquote><p>Export-&gt;Model To Open Exchange File...&quot;.</p></blockquote><h2 id="options"><a class="header-anchor" href="#options" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Options</h2><p>Include Folder Organization If this is checked then the organisational structure of the model&#39;s elements&#39; and relations&#39; folders is included in the exported file.</p><p>Validate after export If this is checked then the exported XML file is validated against the Schema XSD files as a final check.</p><p>Copy XSD schema file to target location If this is checked then the ArchiMate Open Exchange format XSD files are copied to the same location as the output file.</p><p>Language code Sets the two letter language code for string values as defined in ISO 639.</p><h2 id="adding-metadata"><a class="header-anchor" href="#adding-metadata" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Adding Metadata</h2><p>You can also include basic Dublin Core Metadata in the XML exchange file.</p><p>Each model can be further described by the use of Metadata. This constitutes an optional set of elements that can be used to describe the model itself. The use of metadata to further describe a model can be useful to assert such things as publisher, rights and usage, copyright, and licensing. The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set consists of 15 metadata elements:</p><p>Title A name given to the resource.</p><p>Creator An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.</p><p>Subject (^) The topic of the resource. Description An account of the resource. Publisher An entity responsible for making the resource available. Contributor An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource.

The idea behind the Sketch View is inspired by the ArchiMate specification document defining an &quot;Introductory viewpoint&quot;:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>&quot;The Introductory viewpoint forms a subset of the full ArchiMate language\nusing a simplified notation. It is typically used at the start of a design\ntrajectory, when not everything needs to be detailed yet, or to explain the\nessence of an architecture model to non-architects that require a simpler\nnotation. Another use of this basic, less formal viewpoint is that it tries to\navoid the impression that the architectural design is already fixed, an idea\nthat may easily arise when using a more formal, highly structured or\ndetailed visualization. We use a simplified notation for the concepts, and\nfor the relations. All relations except &quot;triggering&quot; and &quot;realization&quot; are\ndenoted by simple lines; &quot;realization&quot; has an arrow in the direction of the\nrealized service; &quot;triggering&quot; is also represented by an arrow.&quot; - ArchiMate\nSpecification 1.0 p.72\n</code></pre></div><p>This is in some ways similar to Marc Lankhorst&#39;s description of modelling processes using conversation techniques whose aim is to capture the essence of the model:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>&quot;In architecture development, we find a number of common conversation\ntechniques where it concerns the communication of architectural models:\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>Brown-paper session: Structured brainstorm-like group session (up to about 15 people) in which items (keywords or short phrases) are elicited from the individuals in the group in answer to a question such as: &#39;What are the key functionality issues in our current IT architecture?&#39; Typically, every individual item is written on a small adhesive note (&#39;Post-It&#39;). The items are then collected on a sheet of paper (traditionally of the cheap brown kind) and, by means of an open and creative group process, structured and categorised. This may involve adding, deleting, merging, or changing items. Usually, a mediator or facilitator is involved.&quot; - Marc Lankhorst et al. &quot;Enterprise Architecture at Work&quot;, Second Edition, p.82</li></ul><p>In Archi it is possible to create a &quot;Sketch View&quot;.

With the Canvas Modelling Toolkit you can design and create re-usable Canvas Templates to share with colleagues or simply or you can use it as a pre-design tool to sketch out ideas and models. You can also link to other Views in your model so you could, for example, link from an ArchiMate View to a Business Model Canvas View to provide a Business Plan.</p><p>The Business Model Canvas in Archi</p><p>The Business Model Canvas is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License</p><h2 id="getting-started"><a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Getting Started</h2><p>The quickest way to get started with the Canvas Modelling Toolkit is to create a new Canvas based on an existing template. We&#39;ll create a new Business Model Canvas.</p><ol><li><p>Create a new Empty Model in the Model Tree. See the instructions here for how to do this.</p></li><li><p>Select the &quot;Views&quot; folder on the Model Tree, right-click on it and select &quot;New-</p><blockquote><p>Canvas from Template...&quot;</p></blockquote></li><li><p>A wizard dialog window will open. Select the &quot;Business Model Canvas&quot; template from the templates in the &quot;Installed Templates&quot; section:</p></li><li><p>Press &quot;Finish&quot;. A new &quot;Business Model Canvas&quot; View will appear in the Model Tree where you can edit the default name. The View itself will be open ready for you to edit:</p></li></ol><p>The Canvas consists of 9 empty &quot;Blocks&quot;. Each Block acts as container that can contain &quot;Stickies&quot; and other objects that are added from the Palette. Each Block is currently locked so that you cannot move or resize it. Effectively, the Blocks act as backdrop containers. Each Block also has a textual &quot;hint&quot; associated with it that show in the Hints Window.</p><p>Add &quot;Stickies&quot; from the Palette and edit the text in the Sticky to create your Canvas model:</p><p>Adding &quot;Stickies&quot; to the Canvas</p><p>The Business Model Canvas is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License</p><p>Getting into the Details</p><p>The main components and concepts that constitute a Canvas are Blocks, Stickies, Images, Connections, Hints and Locking. A Canvas template typically consists of a number of (locked) Blocks and Images onto which the user can add Stickies, Images, Connections and additional Blocks if required. The following sections will describe each of these concepts in detail starting with a description of the Canvas Palette and an example of constructing an imaginary Canvas.</p><p>The Canvas Palette</p><p>When working with a Canvas, the Palette presents you with the tools that you need to create these objects.</p><p>The Canvas Palette</p><p>Select a tool in the Palette and draw it onto the Canvas. The coloured squares represent &quot;Stickies&quot;. Note that you are not restricted to the provided colours as you can change the colour of the Sticky in the Properties Window. Similarly with the provided Connections, you can change the line and arrow head style of a Connection in its Properties Window.</p><p>Constructing a new Canvas - an Example</p><p>Let&#39;s work through the process of constructing our own Canvas based on mapping Past, Present and Future concepts.</p><p>Assuming that you have a model selected in the Model Tree follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Right click on the &quot;Views&quot; folder of your model on the Model Tree and select &quot;New-&gt;Blank Canvas&quot;:</p></li><li><p>The Blank Canvas View will automatically open. You can rename it at this point in the Model Tree if you wish.</p></li><li><p>From the Palette select the Block tool and draw a tall rectangular Block on the Canvas. Edit its text content by clicking on it and changing it to &quot;Past&quot;:</p></li><li><p>Create two more Blocks named &quot;Present&quot; and &quot;Future&quot; adding them to the Canvas so that they line up as follows:</p></li><li><p>Now let&#39;s add some icons to these Blocks to make them visually more appealing. Double-click on the first Block to open the Properties Window. In the Properties Window select the &quot;Image&quot; tab. Then select the &quot;Choose...&quot; drop-down box and the &quot;Set Image...&quot; item:</p></li></ol><div class="language-"><pre><code>When the &quot;My Images&quot; Image Manager dialog window opens, select the &quot;Open\nfrom File...&quot; option and choose an appropriate image from your computer&#39;s file\nsystem. Do the same for the other Blocks.\n</code></pre></div><ol start="6"><li><p>Here&#39;s how it looks so far with the images that we have selected for the three Blocks:</p></li><li><p>Now that we have constructed our three main Blocks we could take this opportunity to change their background colour, their text fonts and positions in the Properties Window. But for now let&#39;s add an Image underneath the Blocks. From the Palette select the Image tool and draw a rectangular Image place-holder on the Canvas right underneath the Blocks. Double-click on the Image place-holder to open the Properties Window. In the Properties Window on the &quot;Main&quot; tab select the &quot;Choose...&quot; drop-down box and the &quot;Set Image...&quot; item, as you did before for a Block, and select an appropriate image from your computer&#39;s file system. Then from the &quot;Appearance&quot; tab set the border to &quot;None&quot;. The Canvas now looks like the following:</p></li></ol><p>Adding Hints and Locking</p><p>For the finishing touches let&#39;s add some Hints to the Blocks and then lock them so that we can re-use the Canvas as a Template. Why do we want to add Hints to the Blocks? Well, as with the other objects in Archi models it&#39;s extremely helpful to provide a rubric that suggests to the end user the intent of the object and how it can be used in the model. Let&#39;s add the hints:</p><ol><li><p>First ensure that the Hints Window is open. You can open it from the main &quot;Window&quot; menu.</p></li><li><p>Double-click on the first Block (the &quot;Past&quot; Block) in order to open the Properties Window.</p></li><li><p>In the Properties Window select the &quot;Hint&quot; tab.</p></li><li><p>Type &quot;Past&quot; for the Hint title, and some text for the Hint Content. Note that you can use HTML to mark up your content text. Here&#39;s what it looks like now:</p></li><li><p>Add Hints for the other Blocks.</p></li><li><p>Now let&#39;s lock all these objects so that we can use the Canvas. Select each Block and the Image in turn. In the Properties Window tick the &quot;Locked&quot; checkbox:</p></li></ol><p>Now that we have created the Blocks, added an Image, provided the Hints and locked the objects we can save the whole thing as a Canvas Template and then create new instances of the Canvas from the template. See the sections &quot;Saving a Canvas as a Template&quot; and &quot;Creating a New Canvas from a Template&quot; to do this.</p><p>Creating a new Canvas instance from the template means we can now start using it for real:</p><p>Our imaginary Canvas</p><p>For more ideas, look at how the built-in Canvas templates are constructed for further examples. See the section &quot;Creating a New Canvas from a Template&quot;.</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Archi uses a different file format for &quot;*.archimate&quot; files when adding\nCanvasses that contain images.\nNormally Archi saves &quot;*.archimate&quot; files as single plain text XML format files.\nHowever, when images are used in a Canvas the file format used is a binary\narchive file (zip format) that contains both the model&#39;s XML file and any\nimage files.

It is possible to move this anchor point just by moving the figure or by creating a bend point in the connection and moving that.</p><p>For example if not ticked (default) the connections appear as follows:</p><p>If ticked the connections appear as follows:</p><p>Use line curves If this is enabled, connections are shown with curves at bend-points.</p><p>Use line jumps for intersecting relations If this is enabled, a jump curve is shown when one connection crosses another.</p><p>Label background Sets the strategy for drawing connection label backgrounds. This can be one of &quot;Transparent&quot;, &quot;Opaque&quot; or &quot;Clipped&quot;.</p><p>General</p><p>Show a warning message when a reconnection affects other Views When making a reconnection between ArchiMate elements in a View those elements and connection may be present in one or more other Views. The reconnection will affect those Views and this warning alerts the user to this and the action can be undone.</p><p>ARM</p><p>Automatic Relationship Management</p><p>For more information see Container Elements and Nested Element Relationships.</p><p>Enable implicit connections in Views for nested elements If this is enabled then nested parent/child elements are considered to have an implicit connection in a View representing a relationship between the elements in the model.</p><p>Offer to create new relation when creating new element from Palette If this is enabled then when a new element is added from the Palette onto a parent element in the View a dialog appears offering to create a new relationship between the parent and child elements.</p><p>Offer to create new relation when adding element from Model Tree If this is enabled then when a new element is added from the Model Tree onto a parent element in the View a dialog appears offering to create a new relationship between the parent and child elements if one does not already exist.</p><p>Offer to create new relation when moving an element to a new parent element If this is enabled then when an element in a View is dragged onto a parent element in the View a dialog appears offering to create a new relationship between the parent and child elements if one does not already exist.</p><p>Relation types offered when creating new relations Select the types of relationship that will be offered when new implicit connections are created between parent and child elements in a View.</p><p>Reverse relation types offered when creating new relations Select the types of relationship that will be offered when new implicit connections are created between child and parent elements in a View.

Resizing at the top or left will create new space in the parent object.</p><p>Child object positions are relative to parent When this option is set child objects maintain their relative position to the parent object when the parent object&#39;s top/left is resized. Resizing at the top or left will not create new space in the parent object.</p><p>Other</p><p>Use older method for drawing images When this option is set an older method for drawing scaled images is used in Canvas image figures. It is faster but image transparency is not preserved. By default this should be disabled but the option is included for backward compatibility.</p><p>Use an offset when drawing outlines on hi-res displays When this option is set figure outlines are drawn with a small offset to compensate for higher resolution displays. This is normally only needed on Windows devices with hi-res displays.</p><p>Appearance</p><p>Global</p><p>These are global settings for the application.</p><p>Word wrap style Set the default word wrap style for ArchiMate figures.</p><p>Hard - wrapping will only occur at valid line breaks.</p><p>Soft - wrapping will always occur at the end of the available space, breaking in the middle of a word. Truncated - wrapping will always occur at the end of available space, truncating a word if it doesn&#39;t fit.</p><p>Defaults for new ArchiMate figures</p><p>These are the defaults to use when creating a new ArchiMate figure.

This is set on by default for Windows operating systems where display scaling is greater than 100%, and on Mac Retina devices. This is so that the exported image quality is not compromised since it is not possible to set a higher DPI in the image. This setting is usually not needed on Linux displays.</p><p>If the resulting image needs to be at its logical size you could edit it in an image editor and set the DPI to double its value.
