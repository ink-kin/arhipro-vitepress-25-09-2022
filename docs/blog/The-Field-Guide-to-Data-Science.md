## FOREWORD

```
Every aspect of our lives, from life-saving disease
treatments, to national security, to economic stability
and even the convenience of selecting a restaurant,
can be improved by creating better data analytics
through Data Science.
```
```
We live in a world of incredible
beauty and complexity. A world
increasingly measured, mapped,
and recorded into digital bits for
eternity. Our human existence
is pouring into the digital realm
faster than ever. From global
business operations to simple
expressions of love – an essential
part of humanity now exists in
the digital world.
```
```
Data is the byproduct of our
new digital existence. Recorded
bits of data from mundane
tra!c cameras to telescopes
peering into the depths of
space are propelling us into
the greatest age of discovery
our species has ever known.
```
```
As we move from isolation into
our ever-connected and recorded
future, data is becoming the
new currency and a vital natural
resource. "e power, importance,
```
```
and responsibility such incredible
data stewardship will demand of
us in the coming decades is hard
to imagine – but we often fail to
fully appreciate the insights data
can provide us today. Businesses
that do not rise to the occasion
and garner insights from this new
resource are destined for failure.
```
```
An essential part of human
nature is our insatiable curiosity
and the need to #nd answers to
our hardest problems. Today, the
emerging #eld of Data Science is
an auspicious and profound new
way of applying our curiosity
and technical tradecraft to create
value from data that solves our
hardest problems. Leaps in
human imagination, vast amounts
of data on hundreds of topics,
and humble algorithms can be
combined to create a radical new
way of thinking about data. Our
future is inextricably tied to data.
```
```
We want to share our passion for Data Science and start a
conversation with you. "is is a journey worth taking.

## THE STORY of THE

## FIELD

## GUIDE

While there are countless industry and academic publications
describing _what_ Data Science is and _why_ we should care, little
information is available to explain how to make use of data as a
resource. At Booz Allen, we built an industry-leading team of
Data Scientists. Over the course of hundreds of analytic
challenges for dozens of clients, we’ve unraveled the DNA of
Data Science. We mapped the Data Science DNA to unravel the
_what_ , the _why_ , the _who_ and the _how_.

Many people have put forth their thoughts on single aspects of
Data Science. We believe we can o!er a broad perspective on the
conceptual models, tradecraft, processes and culture of Data
Science. Companies with strong Data Science teams often focus
on a single class of problems – graph algorithms for social
network analysis and recommender models for online shopping
are two notable examples. Booz Allen is di!erent. In our role as
consultants, we support a diverse set of clients across a variety of
domains. "is allows us to uniquely understand the DNA of
Data Science. Our goal in creating _!e Field Guide to Data Science_
is to capture what we have learned and to share it broadly.
We want this e!ort to help drive forward the science and art
of Data Science.

"is #eld guide came from the passion our team feels for
its work. It is not a textbook nor is it a super#cial treatment.
Senior leaders will walk away with a deeper understanding
of the concepts at the heart of Data Science. Practitioners
will add to their toolbox. We hope everyone will enjoy
the journey.

```
» Why Data Science DNA?
```
```
We view Data Science as having
DNA-like characteristics. Much like
DNA, Data Science is composed
of basic building blocks that are
woven into a thing of great beauty
and complexity. "e building blocks
create the blueprint, but successful
replication also requires carefully
balanced processes and the right
set of environmental conditions.
In the end, every instance may look
super#cially di!erent, but the raw
materials remain the same.

## The SHORT

## VERSION

```
› Data Science is the art of turning data into actions.
It’s all about the tradecraft. Tradecraft is the process, tools and
technologies for humans and computers to work together to
transform data into insights.
```
```
› Data Science tradecraft creates data products.
Data products provide actionable information without exposing
decision makers to the underlying data or analytics (e.g., buy/sell
strategies for !nancial instruments, a set of actions to improve
product yield, or steps to improve product marketing).
```
```
› Data Science supports and encourages shifting between
deductive (hypothesis-based) and inductive (pattern-
based) reasoning.
"is is a fundamental change from traditional analysis approaches.
Inductive reasoning and exploratory data analysis provide a means
to form or re!ne hypotheses and discover new analytic paths.
Models of reality no longer need to be static. "ey are constantly
tested, updated and improved until better models are found.
```
```
› Data Science is necessary for companies to stay with the
pack and compete in the future.
Organizations are constantly making decisions based on gut
instinct, loudest voice and best argument – sometimes they are
even informed by real information. "e winners and the losers in
the emerging data economy are going to be determined by their
Data Science teams.
```
```
› Data Science capabilities can be built over time.
Organizations mature through a series of stages – Collect,
Describe, Discover, Predict, Advise – as they move from data
deluge to full Data Science maturity. At each stage, they can
tackle increasingly complex analytic goals with a wider breadth
of analytic capabilities. However, organizations need not reach
maximum Data Science maturity to achieve success. Signi!cant
gains can be found in every stage.
```
```
› Data Science is a di!erent kind of team sport.
Data Science teams need a broad view of the organization. Leaders
must be key advocates who meet with stakeholders to ferret out
the hardest challenges, locate the data, connect disparate parts of
the business, and gain widespread buy-in.

###### Data Science De!ned

Data Science is the art of turning data into actions. #is is
accomplished through the creation of data products, which provide
actionable information without exposing decision makers to the
underlying data or analytics (e.g., buy/sell strategies for !nancial
instruments, a set of actions to improve product yield, or steps to
improve product marketing).

Performing Data Science requires the extraction of timely, actionable
information from diverse data sources to drive data products.
Examples of data products include answers to questions such as:
“Which of my products should I advertise more heavily to increase
pro!t? How can I improve my compliance program, while reducing
costs? What manufacturing process change will allow me to build a
better product?” #e key to answering these questions is: understand
the data you have and what the data inductively tells you.

```
» Data Product
```
```
A data product provides actionable
information without exposing
decision makers to the underlying
data or analytics. Examples include:
```
- Movie Recommendations
- We a t h e r Fo recasts
- Stock Market Predictions
- Production Process
    Improvements
- Health Diagnosis
- Flu Trend Predictions
- Ta r g e t e d Advertising

**_Read this for additional background:_**

#e term Data Science appeared
in the computer science literature
throughout the 1960s-1980s.
It was not until the late 1990s
however, that the !eld as we
describe it here, began to
emerge from the statistics and
data mining communities
(e.g., [2] and [3]). Data Science
was !rst introduced as an
independent discipline in 2001.[4]^
Since that time, there have been
countless articles advancing the
discipline, culminating with
Data Scientist being declared the
sexiest job of the 21st century.[5]

###### What makes Data Science Di"erent?

```
Data Science supports and encourages shifting between deductive
(hypothesis-based) and inductive (pattern-based) reasoning. #is is
a fundamental change from traditional analytic approaches. Inductive
reasoning and exploratory data analysis provide a means to form or
re!ne hypotheses and discover new analytic paths. In fact, to do the
discovery of signi!cant insights that are the hallmark of Data Science,
you must have the tradecraft and the interplay between inductive
and deductive reasoning. By actively combining the ability to reason
deductively and inductively, Data Science creates an environment
where models of reality no longer need to be static and empirically
based. Instead, they are constantly tested, updated and improved until
better models are found. #ese concepts are summarized in the !gure,
!e Types of Reason and !eir Role in Data Science Tradecraft.
```
```
THE TYPES OF REASON...
```
```
DEDUCTIVE REASONING:
```
```
› Commonly associated
with “formal logic.”
› Involves reasoning from known
premises, or premises presumed
to be true, to a certain conclusion.
› The conclusions reached are
certain, inevitable, inescapable.
```
```
INDUCTIVE REASONING
```
```
› Commonly known as “informal
logic,” or “everyday argument.”
› Involves drawing uncertain
inferences, based on
probabilistic reasoning.
› The conclusions reached
are probable, reasonable,
plausible, believable.
```
```
...AND THEIR ROLE IN DATA SCIENCE TRADECRAFT.
```
```
DEDUCTIVE REASONING:
```
```
› Formulate hypotheses about
relationships and underlying models.
› Carry out experiments with the data
to test hypotheses and models.
```
```
INDUCTIVE REASONING
```
```
› Exploratory data analysis to
discover or refine hypotheses.
› Discover new relationships, insights
and analytic paths from the data.

#e di$erences between Data Science and traditional analytic
approaches do not end at seamless shifting between deductive
and inductive reasoning. Data Science o$ers a distinctly di$erent
perspective than capabilities such as Business Intelligence. Data
Science should not replace Business Intelligence functions within
an organization, however. #e two capabilities are additive and
complementary, each o$ering a necessary view of business operations
and the operating environment. #e !gure, _Business Intelligence and
Data Science – A Comparison,_ highlights the di$erences between the
two capabilities. Key contrasts include:

```
› Discovery vs. Pre-canned Questions: Data Science actually
works on discovering the question to ask as opposed to just
asking it.
› Power of Many vs. Ability of One: An entire team provides
a common forum for pulling together computer science,
mathematics and domain expertise.
› Prospective vs. Retrospective: Data Science is focused on
obtaining actionable information from data as opposed to
reporting historical facts.

###### What is the Impact of Data Science?

```
As we move into the data economy, Data Science is the competitive
advantage for organizations interested in winning – in whatever way
winning is de!ned. #e manner in which the advantage is de!ned
is through improved decision-making. A former colleague liked to
describe data-informed decision making like this: If you have perfect
information or zero information then your task is easy – it is in between
those two extremes that the trouble begins. What he was highlighting is
the stark reality that whether or not information is available, decisions
must be made.
```
```
#e way organizations make decisions has been evolving for half a
century. Before the introduction of Business Intelligence, the only
options were gut instinct, loudest voice, and best argument. Sadly, this
method still exists today, and in some pockets it is the predominant
means by which the organization acts. Take our advice and never, ever
work for such a company!
```
```
Fortunately for our economy, most organizations began to inform
their decisions with real information through the application of
simple statistics. #ose that did it well were rewarded; those that did
not failed. We are outgrowing the ability of simple stats to keep pace
with market demands, however. #e rapid expansion of available data,
and the tools to access and make use of the data at scale, are enabling
fundamental changes to the way organizations make decisions.
```
```
Data Science is required to maintain competitiveness in the
increasingly data-rich environment. Much like the application of
simple statistics, organizations that embrace Data Science will be
rewarded while those that do not will be challenged to keep pace.
As more complex, disparate data sets become available, the chasm
between these groups will only continue to widen. #e !gure,
!e Business Impacts of Data Science, highlights the value awaiting
organizations that embrace Data Science.

###### What is Di"erent Now?

For 20 years IT systems were built the same way. We separated
the people who ran the business from the people who managed the
infrastructure (and therefore saw data as simply another thing they
had to manage). With the advent of new technologies and analytic
techniques, this arti!cial – and highly ine$ective – separation of
critical skills is no longer necessary. For the !rst time, organizations
can directly connect business decision makers to the data. #is simple
step transforms data from being ‘something to be managed’ into

‘something to be valued.’

In the wake of the transformation, organizations face a stark choice:
you can continue to build data silos and piece together disparate
information or you can consolidate your data and distill answers.

From the Data Science perspective, this is a false choice: #e siloed
approach is untenable when you consider the (a) the opportunity
cost of not making maximum use of all available data to help
an organization succeed, and (b) the resource and time costs of
continuing down the same path with outdated processes. #e tangible
bene!ts of data products include:

› **_Opportunity Costs:_** Because Data Science is an emerging !eld,
opportunity costs arise when a competitor implements and
generates value from data before you. Failure to learn and account
for changing customer demands will inevitably drive customers
away from your current o$erings. When competitors are able
to successfully leverage Data Science to gain insights, they can
drive di$erentiated customer value propositions and lead their
industries as a result.

› **_Enhanced Processes:_** As a result of the increasingly interconnected
world, huge amounts of data are being generated and stored
every instant. Data Science can be used to transform data into
insights that help improve existing processes. Operating costs
can be driven down dramatically by e$ectively incorporating the
complex interrelationships in data like never before. #is results
in better quality assurance, higher product yield and more
e$ective operations.


### How does Data Science

### Actually Work?

```
It’s not rocket science... it’s something better - Data Science
```
```
Let’s not kid ourselves - Data Science is a complex !eld. It is di%cult,
intellectually taxing work, which requires the sophisticated integration
of talent, tools and techniques. But as a !eld guide, we need to cut
through the complexity and provide a clear, yet e$ective way to
understand this new world.
```
```
To do this, we will transform the !eld of Data Science into a set of
simpli!ed activities as shown in the !gure, !e Four Key Activities of a
Data Science Endeavor. Data Science purists will likely disagree with
this approach, but then again, they probably don’t need a !eld guide,
sitting as they do in their ivory towers! In the real world, we need
clear and simple operating models to help drive us forward.

Activity 1: Acquire
This activity focuses
on obtaining the
data you need.
Given the nature of
data, the details of
this activity depend
heavily on who you
are and what you
do. As a result, we
will not spend a
lot of time on this
activity other than
to emphasize its
importance and
to encourage an
expansive view on
which data can and
should be used.
```
```
Activity 2: Prepare
Great outcomes
don’t just happen
by themselves.
A lot depends on
preparation, and
in Data Science,
that means
manipulating the
data to fit your
analytic needs.
This stage can
consume a great
deal of time, but
it is an excellent
investment. The
benefits are
immediate and
long term.
```
```
Activity 3: Analyze
This is the activity
that consumes the
lion’s share of the
team’s attention.
It is also the most
challenging and
exciting (you will
see a lot of ‘aha
moments’ occur in
this space). As the
most challenging
and vexing of the
four activities,
this field guide
focuses on helping
you do this better
and faster.
```
```
Activity 4: Act
Every effective
Data Science team
analyzes its data
with a purpose
```
- that is, to turn
data into actions.
Actionable and
impactful insights
are the holy grail
of Data Science.
Converting insights
into action can be a
politically charged
activity, however.
This activity
depends heavily
on the culture and
character of your
organization, so
we will leave you
to figure out those
details for yourself.

```
The Four Key Activities of a Data Science Endeavor
```

###### Acquire

```
All analysis starts with access to data, and for the Data Scientist
this axiom holds true. But there are some signi!cant di$erences –
particularly with respect to the question of who stores, maintains and
owns the data in an organization.
```
```
But before we go there, lets look at what is changing. Traditionally,
rigid data silos arti!cially de!ne the data to be acquired. Stated
another way, the silos create a !lter that lets in a very small amount of
data and ignores the rest. #ese !ltered processes give us an arti!cial
view of the world based on the ‘surviving data,’ rather than one that
shows full reality and meaning. Without a broad and expansive data
set, we can never immerse ourselves in the diversity of the data. We
instead make decisions based on limited and constrained information.
```
```
Eliminating the need for silos gives us access to all the data at once –
including data from multiple outside sources. It embraces the reality
that diversity is good and complexity is okay. #is mindset creates a
completely di$erent way of thinking about data in an organization by
giving it a new and di$erentiated role. Data represents a signi!cant
new pro!t and mission-enhancement opportunity for organizations.
```
```
But as mentioned earlier, this !rst activity is heavily dependent upon
the situation and circumstances. We can’t leave you with anything
more than general guidance to help ensure maximum value:
```
```
› Look inside "rst: What data do you have current access
to that you are not using? #is is in large part the data
being left behind by the !ltering process, and may be
incredibly valuable.
› Remove the format constraints: Stop limiting your data
acquisition mindset to the realm of structured databases.
Instead, think about unstructured and semi-structured data
as viable sources.
› Figure out what’s missing: Ask yourself what data would
make a big di$erence to your processes if you had access to it.
#en go !nd it!
› Embrace diversity: Try to engage and connect to publicly
available sources of data that may have relevance to your
domain area.
```
```
» Not All Data Is Created Equal
```
```
As you begin to aggregate data,
remember that not all data is
created equally. Organizations have
a tendency to collect any data that
is available. Data that is nearby
(readily accessible and easily
obtained) may be cheap to collect,
but there is no guarantee it is the
right data to collect. Focus on the
data with the highest ROI for your
organization. Your Data Science
team can help identify that data.
Also remember that you need to
strike a balance between the data
that you need and the data that you
have. Collecting huge volumes of
data is useless and costly if it is not
the data that you need.
```
**THE FIELD GUIDE** _to_ **DATA SCIENCE**


```
Start Here for the BasicsStart Here for the Basics 2727
```
###### Prepare

Once you have the data, you need to prepare it for analysis.

Organizations often make decisions based on inexact data. Data
stovepipes mean that organizations may have blind spots. #ey are
not able to see the whole picture and fail to look at their data and
challenges holistically. #e end result is that valuable information is
withheld from decision makers. Research has shown almost 33% of
decisions are made without good data or information. [10]

When Data Scientists are able to explore and analyze all the data, new
opportunities arise for analysis and data-driven decision making. #e
insights gained from these new opportunities will signi!cantly change
the course of action and decisions within an organization. Gaining
access to an organization’s complete repository of data, however,
requires preparation.

Our experience shows time and time again that the best tool for
Data Scientists to prepare for analysis is a lake – speci!cally, the Data
Lake.[11] #is is a new approach to collecting, storing and integrating
data that helps organizations maximize the utility of their data.
Instead of storing information in discrete data structures, the Data
Lake consolidates an organization’s complete repository of data in
a single, large view. It eliminates the expensive and cumbersome
data-preparation process, known as Extract/Transform/Load (ETL),
necessary with data silos. #e entire body of information in the Data
Lake is available for every inquiry – and all at once.

###### Analyze

```
We have acquired the data... we have prepared it... now it is time to
analyze it.
```
```
#e Analyze activity requires the greatest e$ort of all the activities
in a Data Science endeavor. #e Data Scientist actually builds the
analytics that create value from data. Analytics in this context is
an iterative application of specialized and scalable computational
resources and tools to provide relevant insights from exponentially
growing data. #is type of analysis enables real-time understanding
of risks and opportunities by evaluating situational, operational and
behavioral data.
```
```
With the totality of data fully accessible in the Data Lake,
organizations can use analytics to !nd the kinds of connections and
patterns that point to promising opportunities. #is high-speed
analytic connection is done within the Data Lake, as opposed to
older style sampling methods that could only make use of a narrow
slice of the data. In order to understand what was in the lake, you had
to bring the data out and study it. Now you can dive into the lake,
bringing your analytics to the data. #e !gure, Analytic Connection in
the Data Lake, highlights the concept of diving into the Data Lake to
discover new connections and patterns.

Data Scientists work across the spectrum of analytic goals – Describe,
Discover, Predict and Advise. #e maturity of an analytic capability
determines the analytic goals encompassed. Many variables play key
roles in determining the di%culty and suitability of each goal for an
organization. Some of these variables are the size and budget of an
organization and the type of data products needed by the decision
makers. A detailed discussion on analytic maturity can be found in
_Data Science Maturity within an Organization_.

In addition to consuming the greatest e$ort, the Analyze activity
is by far the most complex. #e tradecraft of Data Science is an
art. While we cannot teach you how to be an artist, we can share
foundational tools and techniques that can help you be successful.
#e entirety of _Take O" the Training Wheels_ is dedicated to sharing
insights we have learned over time while serving countless clients.
#is includes descriptions of a Data Science product lifecycle and
the _Fractal Analytic Model_ (FAM). #e _Analytic Selection Process_ and
accompanying _Guide to Analytic Selection_ provide key insights into one
of the most challenging tasks in all of Data Science – selecting the
right technique for the job.

###### Act

Now that we have analyzed the data, it’s time to take action.

#e ability to make use of the analysis is critical. It is also very
situational. Like the Acquire activity, the best we can hope for is to
provide some guiding principles to help you frame the output for
maximum impact. Here are some key points to keep in mind when
presenting your results:

1. #e !nding must make sense with relatively little up-front
    training or preparation on the part of the decision maker.
2. #e !nding must make the most meaningful patterns, trends
    and exceptions easy to see and interpret.
3. Every e$ort must be made to encode quantitative data
    accurately so the decision maker can accurately interpret and
    compare the data.
4. #e logic used to arrive at the !nding must be clear and
    compelling as well as traceable back through the data.
5. #e !ndings must answer real business questions.

###### Data Science Maturity within

###### an Organization

#e four activities discussed thus far provide a simpli!ed view of Data
Science. Organizations will repeat these activities with each new Data
Science endeavor. Over time, however, the level of e$ort necessary
for each activity will change. As more data is Acquired and Prepared
in the Data Lake, for example, signi!cantly less e$ort will need to
be expended on these activities. #is is indicative of a maturing Data
Science capability.

Assessing the maturity of your Data Science capability calls for a
slightly di$erent view. We use _!e Data Science Maturity Model_ as
a common framework for describing the maturity progression and
components that make up a Data Science capability. #is framework
can be applied to an organization’s Data Science capability or even
to the maturity of a speci!c solution, namely a data product. At each
stage of maturity, powerful insight can be gained.

```
The Data Science Maturity Model
```

```
Source: Booz Allen Hamilton
```
```
When organizations start out, they have Data Silos. At this stage,
they have not carried out any broad Aggregate activities. #ey may
not have a sense of all the data they have or the data they need. #e
decision to create a Data Science capability signals the transition into
the Collect stage.
```
```
All of your initial e$ort will be focused on identifying and aggregating
data. Over time, you will have the data you need and a smaller
proportion of your e$ort can focus on Collect. You can now begin to
Describe your data. Note, however, that while the proportion of time
spent on Collect goes down dramatically, it never goes away entirely.
#is is indicative of the four activities outlined earlier – you will
continue to Aggregate and Prepare data as new analytic questions
arise, additional data is needed and new data sources become available.
```
```
Organizations continue to advance in maturity as they move through
the stages from Describe to Advise. At each stage they can tackle
increasingly complex analytic goals with a wider breadth of analytic
capabilities. As described for Collect , each stage never goes away
entirely. Instead, the proportion of time spent focused on it goes
down and new, more mature activities begin. A brief description
of each stage of maturity is shown in the table !e Stages of Data
Science Maturity.
```
```
The Stages of Data Science Maturity
```
```
Stage Description Example
```
```
Collect Focuses on collecting internal or external datasets. Gathering sales records and corresponding weather data.
```
```
Describe
```
```
Seeks to enhance or
refine raw data as well
as leverage basic analytic
functions such as counts.
```
```
How are my customers
distributed with respect to
location, namely zip code?
```
```
Discover Identifies hidden relationships or patterns.
```
```
Are there groups within
my regular customers that
purchase similarly?
```
```
Predict
```
```
Utilizes past observations to
predict future observations.
```
```
Can we predict which products
that certain customer groups
are more likely to purchase?
```
```
Advise
```
```
Defines your possible decisions,
optimizes over those decisions,

#e maturity model provides a powerful tool for understanding
and appreciating the maturity of a Data Science capability.
Organizations need not reach maximum maturity to achieve
success. Signi!cant gains can be found in every stage. We believe
strongly that one does not engage in a Data Science e$ort, however,
unless it is intended to produce an output – that is, you have the
intent to _Advise_. #is means simply that each step forward in
maturity drives you to the right in the model diagram. Moving
to the right requires the correct processes, people, culture and
operating model – a robust Data Science capability. _What Does it
Take to Create a Data Science Capability?_ addresses this topic.

We have observed very few organizations actually operating at
the highest levels of maturity, the _Predict_ and _Advise_ stages. #e
tradecraft of _Discover_ is only now maturing to the point that
organizations can focus on advanced _Predict_ and _Advise_ activities.
#is is the new frontier of Data Science. #is is the space in which
we will begin to understand how to close the cognitive gap between
humans and computers. Organizations that reach _Advise_ will be
met with true insights and real competitive advantage.

### What does it Take to Create

### a Data Science Capability?

```
Data Science is all about building teams and culture.
```
```
As with any team sport, Data Science depends on a diverse set of skills
to achieve its objective – winning at the game of improved insights.
You need the three skill sets shown in !e Data Science Venn Diagram
to create a winning team in the world of Data Science.
```
```
Building Data Science teams is di%cult. It requires an understanding
of the types of personalities that make Data Science possible, as well
as a willingness to establish a culture of innovation and curiosity in
your organization. You must also consider how to deploy the team and
gain widespread buy-in from across your organization.

###### Understanding What Makes

###### a Data Scientist

Data Science often requires a signi!cant investment of time across
a variety of tasks. Hypotheses must be generated and data must be
acquired, prepared, analyzed, and acted upon. Multiple techniques
are often applied before one yields interesting results. If that seems
daunting, it is because it is. Data Science is di%cult, intellectually
taxing work, which requires lots of talent: both tangible technical
skills as well as the intangible ‘x-factors.’

#e most important qualities of Data Scientists tend to be the
intangible aspects of their personalities. Data Scientists are by
nature curious, creative, focused, and detail-oriented.

› **_Curiosity_** is necessary to peel apart a problem and examine
the interrelationships between data that may appear
super!cially unrelated.

› **_Creativity_** is required to invent and try new approaches to
solving a problem, which often times have never been applied
in such a context before.

› **_Focus_** is required to design and test a technique over days and
weeks, !nd it doesn’t work, learn from the failure, and try again.

› **_Attention to Detail_** is needed to maintain rigor, and to detect
and avoid over-reliance on intuition when examining data.

Success of a Data Science team requires pro!ciency in three
foundational technical skills: computer science, mathematics and
domain expertise, as re&ected in _!e Data Science Venn Diagram_.
Computers provide the environment in which data-driven
hypotheses are tested, and as such computer science is necessary
for data manipulation and processing. Mathematics provides the
theoretical structure in which Data Science problems are examined.
A rich background in statistics, geometry, linear algebra, and calculus
are all important to understand the basis for many algorithms and
tools. Finally, domain expertise contributes to an understanding of
what problems actually need to be solved, what kind of data exists
in the domain and how the problem space may be instrumented
and measured.

```
» !e Triple !reat Unicorn
```
```
Individuals who are great at all three
of the Data Science foundational
technical skills are like unicorns –
very rare and if you’re ever lucky
enough to !nd one they should be
treated carefully. When you manage
these people:
› Encourage them to lead
your team, but not manage
it. Don’t bog them down
with responsibilities of
management that could be
done by other sta$.
› Put extra e$ort into managing
their careers and interests
within your organization.
Build opportunities for
promotion into your
organization that allow them
to focus on mentoring other
Data Scientists and progressing
the state of the art while also
advancing their careers.
› Make sure that they have the
opportunity to present and
spread their ideas in many
di$erent forums, but also be
sensitive to their time.
```

###### Finding the Athletes for Your Team

```
Building a Data Science team is complex. Organizations must
simultaneously engage existing internal sta$ to create an “anchor” that
can be used to recruit and grow the team, while at the same time
undergo organizational change and transformation to meaningfully
incorporate this new class of employee.
```
```
Building a team starts with identifying existing sta$ within an
organization who have a high aptitude for Data Science. Good
candidates will have a formal background in any of the three
foundational technical skills we mentioned, and will most importantly
have the personality traits necessary for Data Science. #ey may often
have advanced (masters or higher) degrees, but not always. #e very
!rst sta$ you identify should also have good leadership traits and a
sense of purpose for the organization, as they will lead subsequent
sta%ng and recruiting e$orts. Don’t discount anyone – you will !nd
Data Scientists in the strangest places with the oddest combinations
of backgrounds.
```
###### Shaping the Culture

```
Good Data Science requires a highly academic culture of peer review,
where no member of the organization is immune from constructive
criticism. As you build your Data Science practice, you should be
prepared to subject all aspects of your corporate operations to the
curious nature of your Data Science teams. Failure to do so creates
a negative image of a culture that fails to “eat its own dog food,”
and will invite negative re&ection on the brand, both internally and
externally. You should be conscious of any cultural legacies existing in
an organization that are antithetical to Data Science.
```
```
Data Scientists are fundamentally curious and imaginative. We have
a saying on our team, “We’re not nosy, we’re Data Scientists.” #ese
qualities are fundamental to the success of the project and to gaining
new dimensions on challenges and questions. Often Data Science
projects are hampered by the lack of the ability to imagine something
new and di$erent. Fundamentally, organizations must foster trust and
transparent communication across all levels, instead of deference to
authority, in order to establish a strong Data Science team. Managers
should be prepared to invite participation more frequently, and o$er
explanation or apology less frequently.

###### Selecting Your Operating Model

Depending on the size, complexity, and the business drivers,
organizations should consider one of three Data Science operating
models: Centralized, Deployed, or Di$used. #ese three models are
shown in the !gure, _Data Science Operating Models._

**_Centralized Data Science teams_** serve the organization across all
business units. #e team is centralized under a Chief Data Scientist.
#ey serve all the analytical needs of an organization and they all
co-locate together. #e domain experts come to this organization for
brief rotational stints to solve challenges around the business.

**_Deployed Data Science teams_** go to the business unit or group and
reside there for short- or long-term assignments. #ey are their own
entity and they work with the domain experts within the group
to solve hard problems. #ey may be working independently on
particular challenges, but they should always collaborate with the
other teams to exchange tools, techniques and war stories.

**_#e Di$used Data Science team_** is one that is fully embedded with
each group and becomes part of the long-term organization. #ese
teams work best when the nature of the domain or business unit is
already one focused on analytics. However, building a cross-cut view
into the team that can collaborate with other Data Science teams is
critical to the success.

BALANCING THE DATA
SCIENCE TEAM EQUATION
```
```
Balancing the composition of a Data Science team
is much like balancing the reactants and products in
a chemical reaction. Each side of the equation must
represent the same quantity of any particular element.
In the case of Data Science, these elements are the
foundational technical skills computer science (CS),
mathematics (M) and domain expertise (DE). The
reactants, your Data Scientists, each have their own
unique skills composition. You must balance the staff
mix to meet the skill requirements of the Data Science
team, the product in the reaction. If you don’t correctly
balance the equation, your Data Science team will not
have the desired impact on the organization.
```
###### 2 CS M 2 + 2 CS + M DE → CS 4 M 5 DE

```
I n the example above, your project requires four parts
computer science, five parts mathematics and one
part domain expertise. Given the skills mix of the
staff, five people are needed to balance the equation.
Throughout your Data Science project, the skills
requirements of the team will change. You will need
to re-balance the equation to ensure the reactants
balance with the products.
```

###### Success Starts at the Top

Data Science teams, no matter how they are deployed, must have
sponsorship. #ese can start as grass roots e$orts by a few folks to
start tackling hard problems, or as e$orts directed by the CEO.
Depending on the complexity of the organization, direction from top-
down for large organizations is the best for assuaging fears and doubts
of these new groups.

Data Science teams often face harder political headwinds when
solving problems than any technical hurdles. To prove a Data
Science team’s value, the team needs to initially focus on the hardest
problems within an organization that have the highest return for
key stakeholders and will change how the organization approaches
challenges in the future. #is has the e$ect of keeping the team
motivated and encouraged in the face of di%cult challenges. Leaders
must be key advocates who meet with stakeholders to ferret out
the hardest problems, locate the data, connect disparate parts of the
business and gain widespread buy-in.

### Guiding Principles

```
Failing is good; failing quickly is even better.
```
```
#e set of guiding principles that govern how we conduct the
tradecraft of Data Science are based loosely on the central tenets
of innovation, as the two areas are highly connected. #ese principles
are not hard and fast rules to strictly follow, but rather key tenets
that have emerged in our collective consciousness. You should use
these to guide your decisions, from problem decomposition
through implementation.
```
```
› Be willing to fail. At the core of Data Science is the idea of
experimentation. Truly innovative solutions only emerge when
you experiment with new ideas and applications. Failure is an
acceptable byproduct of experimentation. Failures locate regions
that no longer need to be considered as you search for a solution.
› Fail often and learn quickly. In addition to a willingness to fail, be
ready to fail repeatedly. #ere are times when a dozen approaches
must be explored in order to !nd the one that works. While you
shouldn’t be concerned with failing, you should strive to learn from
the attempt quickly. #e only way you can explore a large number
of solutions is to do so quickly.
› Keep the goal in mind. You can often get lost in the details and
challenges of an implementation. When this happens, you lose
sight of your goal and begin to drift o$ the path from data to
analytic action. Periodically step back, contemplate your goal, and
evaluate whether your current approach can really lead you where
you want to go.
› Dedication and focus lead to success. Yo u m u s t o f t e n e x p l o r e
many approaches before !nding the one that works. It’s easy to
become discouraged. You must remain dedicated to your analytic
goal. Focus on the details and the insights revealed by the data.
Sometimes seemingly small observations lead to big successes.
› Complicated does not equal better. As technical practitioners, we
have a tendency to explore highly complex, advanced approaches.
While there are times where this is necessary, a simpler approach
can often provide the same insight. Simpler means easier and
faster to prototype, implement and verify.
```
```
» Tips From the Pros
```
```
It can be easier to rule out a solution
than confirm its correctness. As a
result, focus on exploring obvious
shortcomings that can quickly
disqualify an approach. This will allow
you to focus your time on exploring
truly viable approaches as opposed to
dead ends.
```
```
» Tips From the Pros

If the first thing you try to do is to
create the ultimate solution, you will

**THE FIELD GUIDE** _to_ **DATA SCIENCE**


### #e Importance of Reason

Beware: in the world of Data Science, if it walks like a duck
and quacks like a duck, it might just be a moose.

Data Science supports and encourages shifting between deductive
(hypothesis-based) and inductive (pattern-based) reasoning.
Inductive reasoning and exploratory data analysis provide a means
to form or re!ne hypotheses and discover new analytic paths.
Models of reality no longer need to be static. #ey are constantly
tested, updated and improved until better models are found.

#e analysis of big data has brought inductive reasoning to the
forefront. Massive amounts of data are analyzed to identify
correlations. However, a common pitfall to this approach is confusing
correlation with causation. Correlation implies but does not prove
causation. Conclusions cannot be drawn from correlations until the
underlying mechanisms that relate the data elements are understood.
Without a suitable model relating the data, a correlation may simply
be a coincidence.

```
» Correlation without
Causation
```
```
A common example of this
phenomenon is the high correlation
between ice cream consumption and
the murder rate during the summer
months. Does this mean ice cream
consumption causes murder or,
conversely, murder causes ice cream
consumption? Most likely not, but
you can see the danger in mistaking
correlation for causation. Our job as
Data Scientists is making sure we
understand the di$erence.

## The Dangers of Rejection

```
In the era of big
data, one piece
of analysis that
is frequently
overlooked is
the problem of
finding patterns
when there
are actually no
apparent patterns. In statistics
this is referred to as Type I error.
As scientists, we are always
on the lookout for a new or
interesting breakthrough that
could explain a phenomenon.
We hope to see a pattern in our
data that explains something
or that can give us an answer.
The primary goal of hypothesis
testing is to limit Type I error.
This is accomplished by using
small Į values. For example,
a Į value of 0.05 states that
there is a 1 in 20 chance that
the test will show that there
is something significant when
in actuality there isn’t. This
problem compounds when
testing multiple hypotheses.
When running multiple
hypothesis tests, we are likely
to encounter Type I error. As
more data becomes available
for analysis, Type I error
needs to be controlled.
```
```
One of my projects required
testing the difference between
the means of two microarray
data samples. Microarray
data contains thousands of
measurements but is limited
in the number of observations.
A common analysis approach
is to measure the same genes
under different conditions. If
there is a significant enough
difference in the amount of
gene expression between the
two samples, we can say that
the gene is correlated with a
particular phenotype. One way
to do this is to take the mean of
each phenotype for a particular
```
```
gene and formulate a hypothesis
to test whether there is a
significant difference between
the means. Given that we were
running thousands of these tests
at Į = 0.05, we found several
differences that were significant.
The problem was that some
of these could be caused by
random chance.
```
```
Many corrections exist to
control for false indications of
significance. The Bonferroni
correction is one of the most
conservative. This calculation
lowers the level below which you
will reject the null hypothesis
(your p value). The formula is
alpha/n , where n equals the
number of hypothesis tests
that you are running. Thus, if
you were to run 1,000 tests of
significance at Į= 0.05, your
p value should be less than
0.00005 (0.05/1,000) to reject the
null hypothesis. This is obviously
a much more stringent value.
A large number of the previously
significant values were no longer
significant, revealing the true
relationships within the data.
```
```
The corrected significance gave
us confidence that the observed
expression levels were due to
differences in the cellular gene
expression rather than noise. We
were able to use this information
to begin investigating what
proteins and pathways were
active in the genes expressing
the phenotype of interest. By
solidifying our understanding
of the causal relationships, we
focused our research on the
areas that could lead to new
discoveries about gene function
and, ultimately to improved
medical treatments.
```
**THE FIELD GUIDE** _to_ **DATA SCIENCE**


Reason and common sense are foundational to Data Science. Without it, data is simply
a collection of bits. Context, inferences and models are created by humans and carry
with them biases and assumptions. Blindly trusting your analyses is a dangerous thing
that can lead to erroneous conclusions. When you approach an analytic challenge, you
should always pause to ask yourself the following questions:

› **_What problem are we trying
to solve?_** Articulate the answer
as a sentence, especially when
communicating with the end-
user. Make sure that it sounds
like an answer. For example,
“Given a !xed amount of
human capital, deploying
people with these priorities
will generate the best return
on their time.”

› **_Does the approach make sense?_**
Write out your analytic plan.
Embrace the discipline of
writing, as it brings structure
to your thinking. Back of
the envelope calculations are
an existence proof of your
approach. Without this kind
of preparation, computers are
power tools that can produce
lots of bad answers really fast.

› **_Does the answer make sense?_**
Can you explain the answer?
Computers, unlike children,
do what they are told. Make
sure you spoke to it clearly by
validating that the instructions
you provided are the ones you
intended. Document your
assumptions and make sure
they have not introduced bias
in your work.

› **_Is it a "nding or a mistake?_**
Be skeptical of surprise
!ndings. Experience says that
it if seems wrong, it probably
is wrong. Before you accept
that conclusion, however,
make sure you understand
and can clearly explain why
it is wrong.

```
› Does the analysis address the
original intent? Make sure
that you are not aligning the
answer with the expectations
of the client. Always speak
the truth, but remember that
answers of “your baby is ugly”
require more, not less, analysis.
```
```
› Is the story complete? #e goal
of your analysis is to tell an
actionable story. You cannot
rely on the audience to stitch
the pieces together. Identify
potential holes in your
story and !ll them to avoid
surprises. Grammar, spelling
and graphics matter; your
audience will lose con!dence
in your analysis if your results
look sloppy.
```
```
› Where would we head next?
No analysis is every !nished,
you just run out of resources.
Understand and explain what
additional measures could
be taken if more resources
are found.

### Component Parts of

### Data Science

```
#ere is a web of components that interact to create your
solution space. Understanding how they are connected
is critical to your ability to engineer solutions to Data
Science problems.
```
```
#e components involved in any Data Science project fall into a
number of di$erent categories including the data types analyzed, the
analytic classes used, the learning models employed and the execution
models used to run the analytics. #e interconnection across these
components, shown in the !gure, Interconnection Among the Component
Parts of Data Science , speaks to the complexity of engineering Data
Science solutions. A choice made for one component exerts in&uence
over choices made for others categories. For example, data types
lead the choices in analytic class and learning models, while latency,
timeliness and algorithmic parallelization strategy inform the
execution model. As we dive deeper into the technical aspects of
Data Science, we will begin with an exploration of these components
and touch on examples of each.
```
**_Read this to get the quick and dirty:_**

```
When engineering a Data
Science solution, work from an
understanding of the components
that de!ne the solution space.
Regardless of your analytic goal,
you must consider the data types
with which you will be working,
the classes of analytics you will use
to generate your data product,
```
```
how the learning models embodied
will operate and evolve, and the
execution models that will govern
how the analytic will be run.
You will be able to articulate a
complete Data Science solution
only after considering each of
these aspects.

###### Data Types

Data types and analytic goals go hand-in-hand much like the chicken
and the egg; it is not always clear which comes !rst. Analytic goals are
derived from business objectives, but the data type also in&uences the
goals. For example, the business objective of understanding consumer
product perception drives the analytic goal of sentiment analysis.
Similarly, the goal of sentiment analysis drives the selection of a
text-like data type such as social media content. Data type also
drives many other choices when engineering your solutions.

#ere are a number of ways to classify data. It is common to
characterize data as _structured_ or _unstructured_. Structured data exists
when information is clearly broken out into !elds that have an
explicit meaning and are highly categorical, ordinal or numeric.
A related category, semi-structured, is sometimes used to describe
structured data that does not conform to the formal structure of
data models associated with relational databases or other forms
of data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers.
Unstructured data, such as natural language text, has less clearly
delineated meaning. Still images, video and audio often fall under
the category of unstructured data. Data in this form requires
preprocessing to identify and extract relevant ‘features.’ #e features
are structured information that are used for indexing and retrieval,
or training classi!cation, or clustering models.

Data may also be classi!ed by the rate at which it is generated,
collected or processed. #e distinction is drawn between streaming
data that arrives constantly like a torrent of water from a !re
hose, and batch data, which arrives in buckets. While there is
rarely a connection between data type and data rate, data rate has
signi!cant in&uence over the execution model chosen for analytic
implementation and may also inform a decision of analytic class or
learning model.

###### Classes of Analytic Techniques

```
As a means for helping conceptualize the universe of possible analytic
techniques, we grouped them into nine basic classes. Note that
techniques from a given class may be applied in multiple ways to
achieve various analytic goals. Membership in a class simply indicates
a similar analytic function. #e nine analytic classes are shown in the
!gure, Classes of Analytic Techniques.
```
```
»  Transforming Analytics
› Aggregation : Techniques to summarize the data. #ese
include basic statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation),
distribution !tting, and graphical plotting.
› Enrichment : Techniques for adding additional information
to the data, such as source information or other labels.
› Processing : Techniques that address data cleaning,
preparation, and separation. #is group also includes
common algorithm pre-processing activities such as
transformations and feature extraction.
```
```
»  Learning Analytics
› Regression : Techniques for estimating relationships among
variables, including understanding which variables are
important in predicting future values.
› Clustering : Techniques to segment the data into naturally
similar groups.
› Classi"cation : Techniques to identify data element
group membership.
› Recommendation : Techniques to predict the rating or
preference for a new entity, based on historic preference
or behavior.
```
```
»  Predictive Analytics

world process or system. #ese are useful for predicting

###### Learning Models

Analytic classes that perform predictions such as regression,
clustering, classi!cation, and recommendation employ learning
models. #ese models characterize how the analytic is trained to
perform judgments on new data based on historic observation.
Aspects of learning models describe both the types of judgments
performed and how the models evolve over time, as shown in the
!gure, _Analytic Learning Models_.

#e learning models are typically described as employing
unsupervised or supervised learning. Supervised learning takes place
when a model is trained using a labeled data set that has a known
class or category associated with each data element. #e model
relates the features found in training instances with the labels so
that predictions can be made for unlabeled instances. Unsupervised
learning models have no a-priori knowledge about the classes into
which data can be placed. #ey use the features in the dataset to form
groupings based on feature similarity.

A useful distinction of learning models is between those that are
trained in a single pass, which are known as o'ine models, and those
that are trained incrementally over time, known as online models.
Many learning approaches have online or o'ine variants. #e decision
to use one or another is based on the analytic goals and execution
models chosen.

Generating an o'ine model requires taking a pass over the entire
training data set. Improving the model requires making separate
passes over the data. #ese models are static in that once trained, their
predictions will not change until a new model is created through a
subsequent training stage. O'ine model performance is easier to
evaluate due to this deterministic behavior. Deployment of the model
into a production environment involves swapping out the old model
for the new.

Online models have both advantages and disadvantages. #ey
dynamically evolve over time, meaning they only require a single
deployment into a production setting. #e fact that these models do
not have the entire dataset available when being trained, however,
is a challenge. #ey must make assumptions about the data based

on the examples observed; these assumptions may be sub-optimal.
#is can be o$set somewhat in cases where feedback on the model’s
predictions is available since online models can rapidly incorporate
feedback to improve performance.
```
###### Execution Models

```
Execution models describe how data is manipulated to perform
an analytic function. #ey may be categorized across a number
of dimensions. Execution Models are embodied by an execution
framework, which orchestrates the sequencing of analytic
computation. In this sense, a framework might be as simple as a
programming language runtime, such as the Python interpreter, or
a distributed computing framework that provides a speci!c API for
one or more programming languages such as Hadoop, MapReduce
or Spark. Grouping execution models based on how they handle data
is common, classifying them as either batch or streaming execution
models. #e categories of execution model are shown in the !gure,
Analytic Execution Models.
```
```
Analytic Execution Models
```
```
A batch execution model implies that data is analyzed in large
segments, that the analytic has a state where it is running and a state
where it is not running and that little state is maintained in memory
between executions. Batch execution may also imply that the analytic
produces results with a frequency on the order of several minutes or
more. Batch workloads tend to be fairly easy to conceptualize because
they represent discrete units of work. As such, it is easy to identify
a speci!c series of execution steps as well as the proper execution
frequency and time bounds based on the rate at which data arrives.
Depending on the algorithm choice, batch execution models are
easily scalable through parallelism. #ere are a number of frameworks
that support parallel batch analytic execution. Most famously,
Hadoop provides a distributed batch execution model in its
MapReduce framework.
```
```
Conversely, a streaming model analyzes data as it arrives. Streaming
execution models imply that under normal operation, the analytic
is always executing. #e analytic can hold state in memory and

**THE FIELD GUIDE** _to_ **DATA SCIENCE**


constantly deliver results as new data arrives, on the order of seconds
or less. Many of the concepts in streaming are inherent in the Unix-
pipeline design philosophy; processes are chained together by linking
the output of one process to the input of the next. As a result, many
developers are already familiar with the basic concepts of streaming.
A number of frameworks are available that support the parallel
execution of streaming analytics such as Storm, S4 and Samza.

#e choice between batch and streaming execution models often
hinges on analytic latency and timeliness requirements. Latency refers
to the amount of time required to analyze a piece of data once it
arrives at the system, while timeliness refers to the average age of an
answer or result generated by the analytic system. For many analytic
goals, a latency of hours and timeliness of days is acceptable and
thus lend themselves to the implementation enabled by the batch
approach. Some analytic goals have up-to-the-second requirements
where a result that is minutes old has little worth. #e streaming
execution model better supports such goals.

Batch and streaming execution models are not the only dimensions
within which to categorize analytic execution methods. Another
distinction is drawn when thinking about scalability. In many cases,
scale can be achieved by spreading computation over a number of
computers. In this context, certain algorithms require a large shared
memory state, while others are easily parallelizable in a context
where no shared state exists between machines. #is distinction has
signi!cant impacts on both software and hardware selection when
building out a parallel analytic execution environment.

```
» Tips From the Pros
```
```
In order to understand system capacity
in the context of streaming analytic
execution, collect metrics including:
the amount of data consumed, data
emitted, and latency. This will help
you understand when scale limits
are reached.

### Fractal Analytic Model

```
Data Science analytics are a lot like broccoli.
```
```
Fractals are mathematical sets that display self-similar patterns. As
you zoom in on a fractal, the same patterns reappear. Imagine a stalk
of broccoli. Rip o$ a piece of broccoli and the piece looks much like
the original stalk. Progressively smaller pieces of broccoli still look like
the original stalk.
```
```
Data Science analytics are a lot like broccoli – fractal in nature in
both time and construction. Early versions of an analytic follow the
same development process as later versions. At any given iteration, the
analytic itself is a collection of smaller analytics that often decompose
into yet smaller analytics.

**THE FIELD GUIDE** _to_ **DATA SCIENCE**


**Goal**

You must !rst have some idea of your analytic goal and the end state
of the analysis. Is it to Discover, Describe, Predict, or Advise? It is
probably a combination of several of those. Be sure that before you
start, you de!ne the business value of the data and how you plan to
use the insights to drive decisions, or risk ending up with interesting
but non-actionable trivia.

**Data**

Data dictates the potential insights that analytics can provide. Data
Science is about !nding patterns in variable data and comparing those
patterns. If the data is not representative of the universe of events you
wish to analyze, you will want to collect that data through carefully
planned variations in events or processes through A/B testing or
design of experiments. Data sets are never perfect so don’t wait for
perfect data to get started. A good Data Scientist is adept at handling
messy data with missing or erroneous values. Just make sure to spend
the time upfront to clean the data or risk generating garbage results.

**Computation**

Computation aligns the data to goals through the process of creating
insights. #rough divide and conquer, computation decomposes
into several smaller analytic capabilities with their own goals, data,
computation and resulting actions, just like a smaller piece of broccoli
maintains the structure of the original stalk. In this way, computation
itself is fractal. Capability building blocks may utilize di$erent
types of execution models such as batch computation or streaming,
that individually accomplish small tasks. When properly combined
together, the small tasks produce complex, actionable results.

**Action**

How should engineers change the manufacturing process to generate
higher product yield? How should an insurance company choose
which policies to o$er to whom and at what price? #e output of
computation should enable actions that align to the goals of the data
product. Results that do not support or inspire action are nothing but
interesting trivia.

Given the fractal nature of Data Science analytics in time and
construction, there are many opportunities to choose fantastic or
shoddy analytic building blocks. _!e Analytic Selection Process_ o$ers
some guidance.

### #e Analytic

### Selection Process

```
If you focus only on the science aspect of Data Science you will
never become a data artist.
```
```
A critical step in Data Science is to identify an analytic technique that
will produce the desired action. Sometimes it is clear; a characteristic
of the problem (e.g., data type) points to the technique you should
implement. Other times, however, it can be di%cult to know where
to begin. #e universe of possible analytic techniques is large. Finding
your way through this universe is an art that must be practiced. We
are going to guide you on the next portion of your journey - becoming
a data artist.
```
**THE FIELD GUIDE** _to_ **DATA SCIENCE**


###### Decomposing the Problem

Decomposing the problem into manageable pieces is the !rst step
in the analytic selection process. Achieving a desired analytic action
often requires combining multiple analytic techniques into a holistic,
end-to-end solution. Engineering the complete solution requires that
the problem be decomposed into progressively smaller sub-problems.

#e _Fractal Analytic Model_ embodies this approach. At any given
stage, the analytic itself is a collection of smaller computations that
decompose into yet smaller computations. When the problem is
decomposed far enough, only a single analytic technique is needed
to achieve the analytic goal. Problem decomposition creates multiple
sub-problems, each with their own goals, data, computations, and
actions. #e concept behind problem decomposition is shown in the
!gure, _Problem Decomposition Using the Fractal Analytic Model_.

```
On the surface, problem decomposition appears to be a mechanical,
repeatable process. While this may be true conceptually, it is
really the performance of an art as opposed to the solving of an
engineering problem. #ere may be many valid ways to decompose
the problem, each leading to a di$erent solution. #ere may be
hidden dependencies or constraints that only emerge after you begin
developing a solution. #is is where art meets science. Although the
art behind problem decomposition cannot be taught, we have distilled
some helpful hints to help guide you. When you begin to think about
decomposing your problem, look for:
```
```
› Compound analytic goals that create natural segmentation.
For example, many problems focused on predicting future
conditions include both Discover and Predict goals.
› Natural orderings of analytic goals. For example, when extracting
features you must !rst identify candidate features and then
select the features set with the highest information value. #ese
two activities form distinct analytic goals.
› Data types that dictate processing activities. For example, text or
imagery both require feature extraction.
› Requirements for human-in-the-loop feedback. For example,
when developing alerting thresholds, you might need to solicit
analyst feedback and update the threshold based on their
assessment.
› #e need to combine multiple data sources. For example, you may
need to correlate two data sets to achieve your broader goal.
Often this indicates the presence of a Discover goal.
```
```
In addition to problem decomposition providing a tractable approach
to analytic selection, it has the added bene!t of simplifying a highly
complex problem. Rather than being faced with understanding the
entire end-to-end solution, the computations are discrete segments
that can be explored. Note, however, that while this technique helps
the Data Scientist approach the problem, it is the complete end-to-
end solution that must be evaluated.
```
```
» Tips From the Pros
```
```
One of your first steps should be to
explore available data sources that
have not been previously combined.
Emerging relationships between data
sources often allow you to pick low
hanging fruit.

## Identifying Spoofed Domains

```
Identifying spoofed domains is important for an organization
to preserve their brand image and to avoid eroded customer
confidence. Spoofed domains occur when a malicious actor
creates a website, URL or email address that users believe is
associated with a valid organization. When users click the link,
visit the website or receive emails, they are subjected to some
type of nefarious activity.
```
Our team was faced with the problem of
identifying spoofed domains for a commercial
company. On the surface, the problem sounded
easy; take a recently registered domain, check
to see if it is similar to the company’s domain
and alert when the similarity is sufficiently high.
Upon decomposing the problem, however, the
main computation quickly became complicated.

We needed a computation that determined
similarity between two domains. As we
decomposed the similarity computation,
complexity and speed became a concern.
As with many security-related problems, fast

```
alert speeds are vital. Result speed created
an implementation constraint that forced us to
re-evaluate how we decomposed the problem.
```
```
Revisiting the decomposition process led us
to a completely new approach. In the end,
we derived a list of domains similar to those
registered by the company. We then compared
that list against a list of recently registered
domains. The figure, Spoofed Domain Problem
Decomposition, illustrates our approach. Upon
testing and initial deployment, our analytic
discovered a spoofed domain within 48 hours.

###### Implementation Constraints

In the spoofed domains case study, the emergence of an
implementation constraint caused the team to revisit its approach.
#is demonstrates that analytic selection does not simply mean
choosing an analytic technique to achieve a desired outcome. It also
means ensuring that the solution is feasible to implement.

#e Data Scientist may encounter a wide variety of implementation
constraints. #ey can be conceptualized, however, in the context of
!ve dimensions that compete for your attention: analytic complexity,
speed, accuracy & precision, data size, and data complexity. Balancing
these dimensions is a zero sum game - an analytic solution cannot
simultaneously exhibit all !ve dimensions, but instead must make
trades between them. #e !gure, _Balancing the Five Analytic
Dimensions,_ illustrates this relationship.

Implementation constraints occur when an aspect of the problem
dictates the value for one or more of these dimensions. As soon as
one dimension is !xed, the Data Scientist is forced to make trades
among the others. For example, if the analytic problem requires
actions to be produced in near real-time, the speed dimension is
!xed and trades must be made among the other four dimensions.
Understanding which trades will achieve the right balance among
the !ve dimensions is an art that must be learned over time.

```
As we compiled this section, we
talked extensively about ways to
group and classify implementation
constraints. After much discussion
we settled on these !ve dimensions.
We present this model in hopes
that others weigh in and o$er
their own perspectives.

Some common examples of implementation
constraints include:
```
**_- Computation frequency._** #e solution may need to run on a regular
    basis (e.g., hourly), requiring that computations be completed
    within a speci!ed window of time. #e best analytic is useless if it
    cannot solve the problem within the required time.
**_- Solution timeliness._** Some applications require near real-time
    results, pointing toward streaming approaches. While some
    algorithms can be implemented within streaming frameworks,
    many others cannot.
**_- Implementation speed._** A project may require that you rapidly
    develop and implement a solution to quickly produce analytic
    insights. In these cases, you may need to focus on less complex
    techniques that can be quickly implemented and veri!ed.
**_- Computational resource limitations._** Although you may be able
    to store and analyze your data, data size may be su%ciently large
    that algorithms requiring multiple computations across the full
    data set are too resource intensive. #is may point toward needing
    approaches that only require a single pass on the data (e.g., canopy
    cluster as opposed to k-means clustering).
**_- Data storage limitations_**. #ere are times when big data becomes
    so big it cannot be stored or only a short time horizon can be
    stored. Analytic approaches that require long time horizons may
    not be possible.

```
Organizational policies and regulatory requirements are a major
source of implicit constraints that merit a brief discussion. Policies
are often established around speci!c classes of data such as Personally
Identi!able Information (PII) or Personal Health Information (PHI).
While the technologies available today can safely house information
with a variety of security controls in a single system, these policies
force special data handling considerations including limited retention
periods and data access. Data restrictions impact the data size and
complexity dimensions outlined earlier, creating yet another layer of
constraints that must be considered.
```
```

When possible, consider approaches
that make use of previously computed
results. Your algorithm will run
much faster if you can avoid
re-computing values across
the full time horizon of data.

Hidden Markov
Models

```
Models sequential data by
determining the discrete
latent variables, but
the observables may be

```
```
One of the most powerful properties of Hidden
Markov Models is their ability to exhibit
some degree of invariance to local warping
(compression and stretching) of the time axis.
However, a significant weakness of the Hidden
Markov Model is the way in which it represents
the distribution of times for which the system
remains in a given state.

solutions. In this section, we list a few
important topics to Data Science coupled
with firsthand experience from our experts.

### Feature Engineering

```
Feature engineering is a lot like oxygen. You can’t do without
it, but you rarely give it much thought.
```
```
Feature engineering is the process by which one establishes the
representation of data in the context of an analytic approach. It is the
foundational skill in Data Science. Without feature engineering, it
would not be possible to understand and represent the world through
a mathematical model. Feature engineering is a challenging art. Like
other arts, it is a creative process that manifests uniquely in each
Data Scientist. It will be in&uenced substantially by the scientist’s
experiences, tastes and understanding of the !eld.
```
```
As the name suggests, feature engineering can be a complex task
that may involve chaining and testing di$erent approaches. Features
may be simple such as “bag of words,” a popular technique in the
text processing domain, or or may be based on more complex
representations derived through activities such as machine learning.
You make use of the output of one analytic technique to create the
representation that is consumed by another. More often than not, you
will !nd yourself operating in the world of highly complex activities.

## Chemoinformatic Search

```
On one assignment, my
team was confronted
with the challenge of
developing a search
engine over chemical
compounds. The goal
of chemoinformatic
search is to predict
the properties that
a molecule will exhibit as well as to
provide indices over those predicted
properties to facilitate data discovery
in chemistry-based research. These
properties may either be discreet (e.g.,
“a molecule treats disease x well”)
or continuous (e.g., “a molecule may
be dissolved up to 100.21 g/ml”).
```
```
Molecules are complex 3D structures,
which are typically represented as
a list of atoms joined by chemical
bonds of differing lengths with varying
electron domain and molecular
geometries. The structures are
specified by the 3-space coordinates
and the electrostatic potential
surface of the atoms in the molecule.
Searching this data is a daunting
task when one considers that
naïve approaches to the problem
bear significant semblance to the
Graph Isomorphism Problem.[13]
```
```
The solution we developed was
based on previous work in molecular
fingerprinting (sometimes also called
hashing or locality sensitive hashing).
Fingerprinting is a dimensionality
reduction technique that dramatically
reduces the problem space by
summarizing many features, often
with relatively little regard to the
importance of the feature. When
an exact solution is likely to be
infeasible, we often turn to heuristic
approaches such as fingerprinting.
```
```
Our approach used a training set
where all the measured properties
```
```
of the molecules were available. We
created a model of how molecular
structural similarities might affect
their properties. We began by
finding all the sub-graphs of each
molecule with length n , resulting
in a representation similar to
the bag-of-words approach from
natural language processing.
We summarized each molecule
fragment in a type of fingerprint
called a “Counting Bloom Filter.”
```
```
Next, we used several exemplars from
the set to create new features. We
found the distance from each member
of the full training set to each of the
exemplars. We fed these features into
a non-linear regression algorithm
to yield a model that could be used
on data that was not in the original
training set. This approach can be
conceptualized as a “hidden manifold,”
whereby a hidden surface or shape
defines how a molecule will exhibit a
property. We approximate this shape
using a non-linear regression and a
set of data with known properties.
Once we have the approximate
shape, we can use it to predict the
properties of new molecules.
```
```
Our approach was multi-staged and
complex – we generated sub-graphs,
created bloom filters, calculated
distance metrics and fit a linear-
regression model. This example
provides an illustration of how many
stages may be involved in producing a
sophisticated feature representation.
By creatively combining and building
“features on features,” we were able
to create new representations of data
that were richer and more descriptive,
yet were able to execute faster and
produce better results.

### Feature Selection

```
Models are like honored guests; you should only feed them the
good parts.
```
```
Feature selection is the process of determining the set of features with
the highest information value to the model. Two main approaches are
!ltering and wrapper methods. Filtering methods analyze features
using a test statistic and eliminate redundant or non-informative
features. As an example, a !ltering method could eliminate features
that have little correlation to the class labels. Wrapper methods
utilize a classi!cation model as part of feature selection. A model is
trained on a set of features and the classi!cation accuracy is used to
measure the information value of the feature set. One example is that
of training a neural network with a set of features and evaluating the
accuracy of the model. If the model scores highly on the test set, then
the features have high information value. All possible combinations of
features are tested to !nd the best feature set.
```
```
#ere are tradeo$s between these techniques. Filtering methods
are faster to compute since each feature only needs to be compared
against its class label. Wrapper methods, on the other hand, evaluate
feature sets by constructing models and measuring performance. #is
requires a large number of models to be trained and evaluated (a
quantity that grows exponentially in the number of features). Why
would anyone use a wrapper method? Feature sets may perform better
than individual features.[14] With !lter methods, a feature with weak
correlation to its class labels is eliminated. Some of these eliminated
features, however, may have performed well when combined with
other features.

## Cancer Cell Classification

```
On one project,
our team was
challenged
to classify
cancer cell
profiles. The
overarching
goal was
to classify different types
of Leukemia, based on
Microarray profiles from 72
samples[15] using a small
set of features. We utilized
a hybrid Artificial Neural
Network (ANN)[16] and Genetic
Algorithm[17] to identify subsets
of 10 features selected from
thousands.[18] We trained the
ANN and tested performance
using cross-fold validation.
The performance measure
```
```
was used as feedback into
the Genetic Algorithm. When
a set of features contained
no useful information, the
model performed poorly and
a different feature set would
be explored. Over time, this
method selected a set of
features that performed with
high accuracy. The down-
selected feature set increased
speed and performance as
well as allowed for better
insight into the factors that
may govern the system. This
allowed our team to design
a diagnostic test for only a
few genetic markers instead
of thousands, substantially
reducing diagnostic test
complexity and cost.

### Data Veracity

```
We’re Data Scientists, not data alchemists. We can’t make
analytic gold from the lead of data.
```
```
While most people associate data volume, velocity, and variety with
big data, there is an equally important yet often overlooked dimension
```
- data veracity. Data veracity refers to the overall quality and
correctness of the data. You must assess the truthfulness and accuracy
of the data as well as identify missing or incomplete information. As
the saying goes, “Garbage in, garbage out.” If your data is inaccurate or
missing information, you can’t hope to make analytic gold.

```
Assessing data truthfulness is often subjective. You must rely on your
experience and an understanding of the data origins and context.
Domain expertise is particularly critical for the latter. Although
data accuracy assessment may also be subjective, there are times that
quantitative methods may be used. You may be able to re-sample from
the population and conduct a statistical comparison against the stored
values, thereby providing measures of accuracy.
```
```
#e most common issues you will encounter are missing or
incomplete information. #ere are two basic strategies for dealing
with missing values – deletion and imputation. In the former, entire
observations are excluded from analysis, reducing sample size and
potentially introducing bias. Imputation, or replacement of missing
or erroneous values, uses a variety of techniques such as random
sampling (hot deck imputation) or replacement using the mean,
statistical distributions or models.
```
```
» Tips From the Pros
```
```
Find an approach that works,
implement it, and move on. You
can worry about optimization and
tuning your approaches later during
incremental improvement.

## Time Series Modeling

```
On one of our projects, the team was faced with correlating the time
series for various parameters. Our initial analysis revealed that the
correlations were almost non-existent. We examined the data and
quickly discovered data veracity issues. There were missing and
null values, as well as negative-value observations, an impossibility
given the context of the measurements (see the figure, Time Series
Data Prior to Cleansing ). Garbage data meant garbage results.
```
Because sample size was already small, deleting
observations was undesirable. The volatile nature
of the time series meant that imputation through
sampling could not be trusted to produce values
in which the team would be confident. As a result,
we quickly realized that the best strategy was an
approach that could filter and correct the noise in
the data.

We initially tried a simplistic approach in which we
replaced each observation with a moving average.
While this corrected some noise, including the
outlier values in our moving-average computation
shifted the time series. This caused undesirable

```
distortion in the underlying signal, and we quickly
abandoned the approach.
One of our team members who had experience in
signal processing suggested a median filter. The
median filter is a windowing technique that moves
through the data point-by-point, and replaces it
with the median value calculated for the current
window. We experimented with various window
sizes to achieve an acceptable tradeoff between
smoothing noise and smoothing away signal. The
figure, Time Series Data After Cleansing , shows the
same two time series after median filter imputation.
```
The application of the median filter approach was
hugely successful. Visual inspection of the time
series plots reveals smoothing of the outliers
without dampening the naturally occurring peaks
and troughs (no signal loss). Prior to smoothing,
we saw no correlation in our data, but afterwards,
Spearman’s Rho was ~0.5 for almost all parameters.

```
By addressing our data veracity issues, we were
able to create analytic gold. While other approaches
may also have been effective, implementation speed
constraints prevented us from doing any further
analysis. We achieved the success we were after and
moved on to address other aspects of the problem.

### Application of

### Domain Knowledge

```
We are all special in our own way. Don’t discount what
you know.
```
```
Knowledge of the domain in which a problem lies is immensely
valuable and irreplaceable. It provides an in-depth understanding
of your data and the factors in&uencing your analytic goal. Many
times domain knowledge is a key di$erentiator to a Data Science
team’s success. Domain knowledge in&uences how we engineer and
select features, impute data, choose an algorithm, and determine
success. One person cannot possibly be a domain expert in every
!eld, however. We rely on our team, other analysts and domain
experts as well as consult research papers and publications to build
an understanding of the domain.

## Motor Vehicle Theft

```
On one project,
our team explored
how Data Science
could be applied to
improve public safety.
According to the
FBI, approximately
$8 Billion is lost
annually due to
automobile theft. Recovery of the
one million vehicles stolen every
year in the U.S. is less than 60%.
Dealing with these crimes represents
a significant investment of law
enforcement resources. We wanted
to see if we could identify how to
reduce auto theft while efficiently
using law enforcement resources.
```
```
Our team began by parsing and
verifying San Francisco crime data.
We enriched stolen car reporting with
general city data. After conducting
several data experiments across both
space and time, three geospatial and
one temporal hotspot emerged (see
figure, Geospatial and Temporal Car
Theft Hotspots ). The domain expert
on the team was able to discern
that the primary geospatial hotspot
corresponded to an area surrounded
by parks. The parks created an urban
mountain with a number of over-foot
access points that were conducive to
car theft.
```
```
Our team used the temporal hotspot information in tandem with the insights
from the domain expert to develop a Monte Carlo model to predict the likelihood
of a motor vehicle theft at particular city intersections. By prioritizing the
intersections identified by the model, local governments would have the
information necessary to efficiently deploy their patrols. Motor vehicle thefts
could be reduced and law enforcement resources could be more efficiently
deployed. The analysis, enabled by domain expertise, yielded actionable insights
that could make the streets safer.

### !e Curse of

### Dimensionality

```
!ere is no magical potion to cure the curse, but there is PCA.
```
```
!e “curse of dimensionality” is one of the most important results
in machine learning. Most texts on machine learning mention this
phenomenon in the "rst chapter or two, but it often takes many years
of practice to understand its true implications.
```
```
Classi"cation methods, like most machine learning methods, are
subject to the implications of the curse of dimensionality. !e basic
intuition in this case is that as the number of data dimensions
increases, it becomes more di#cult to create generalizable
classi"cation models (models that apply well over phenomena not
observed in the training set). !is di#culty is usually impossible to
overcome in real world settings. !ere are some exceptions in domains
where things happen to work out, but usually you must work to
minimize the number of dimensions. !is requires a combination
of clever feature engineering and use of dimensionality reduction
techniques (see Feature Engineering and Feature Selection Life in the
Trenches ). In our practical experience, the maximum
number of dimensions seems to be ~10 for linear model-based
approaches. !e limit seems to be in the tens of thousands for more
sophisticated methods such as support vector machines, but the limit
still exists nonetheless.
```
```
A counterintuitive consequence of the curse of dimensionality is
that it limits the amount of data needed to train a classi"cation
model. !ere are roughly two reasons for this phenomenon. In one
case, the dimensionality is small enough that the model can be
trained on a single machine. In the other case, the exponentially
expanding complexity of a high-dimensionality problem makes it
(practically) computationally impossible to train a model. In our
experience, it is quite rare for a problem to fall in a “sweet spot”
between these two extremes.
```
```
!is observation is not to say that such a condition never arises. We
believe it is rare enough, however, that practitioners need not concern
themselves with how to address this case. Rather than trying to create
super-scalable algorithm implementations, focus your attention on
solving your immediate problems with basic methods. Wait until you
encounter a problem where an algorithm fails to converge or provides
poor cross-validated results, and then seek new approaches. Only
when you "nd that alternate approaches don’t already exist, should you
begin building new implementations. !e expected cost of this work
pattern is lower than over-engineering right out of the gate.
```
```
Put otherwise, “Keep it simple, stupid”.

## Baking the Cake

```
I was once given a time series set of roughly
1,600 predictor variables and 16 target variables
and asked to implement a number of modeling
techniques to predict the target variable
values. The client was challenged to handle the
complexity associated with the large number of
variables and needed help. Not only did I have
a case of the curse, but the predictor variables
were also quite diverse. At first glance, it looked
like trying to bake a cake with everything in the cupboard.
That is not a good way to bake or to make predictions!
```
```
The data diversity could be
partially explained by the fact
that the time series predictors
did not all have the same
periodicity. The target time
series were all daily values
whereas the predictors were
daily, weekly, quarterly, and
monthly. This was tricky to
sort out, given that imputing
zeros isn’t likely to produce
good results. For this specific
reason, I chose to use neural
networks for evaluating the
weekly variable contributions.
```
```
Using this approach, I was
able to condition upon week,
without greatly increasing
the dimensionality. For the
other predictors, I used
a variety of techniques,
including projection and
correlation, to make heads
or tails of the predictors. My
approach successfully reduced
the number of variables,
accomplishing the client’s goal
of making the problem space
tractable. As a result, the cake
turned out just fine.

### Model Validation

```
Repeating what you just heard does not mean that you
learned anything.
```
```
Model validation is central to construction of any model. #is answers
the question “How well did my hypothesis !t the observed data?”
If we do not have enough data, our models cannot connect the dots.
On the other hand, given too much data the model cannot think
outside of the box. #e model learns speci!c details about the training
data that do not generalize to the population. #is is the problem of
model over !tting.
```
```
Many techniques exist to combat model over !tting. #e simplest
method is to split your data set into training, testing and validation
sets. #e training data is used to construct the model. #e model
constructed with the training data is then evaluated with the testing
data. #e performance of the model against the testing set is used to
further reduce model error. #is indirectly includes the testing data
within model construction, helping to reduce model over !t. Finally,
the model is evaluated on the validation data to assess how well the
model generalizes.
```
```
A few methods where the data is split into training and testing sets
include: k -fold cross-validation, Leave-One-Out cross-validation,
bootstrap methods, and resampling methods. Leave-One-Out cross-
validation can be used to get a sense of ideal model performance
over the training set. A sample is selected from the data to act as the
testing sample and the model is trained on the rest of the data. #e
error on the test sample is calculated and saved, and the sample is
returned to the data set. A di$erent sample is then selected and the
process is repeated. #is continues until all samples in the testing set
have been used. #e average error over the testing examples gives a
measure of the model’s error.
```
```
#ere are other approaches for testing how well your hypothesis
re&ects the data. Statistical methods such as calculating the coe%cient
of determination, commonly called the R -squared value are used to
identify how much variation in the data your model explains. Note
that as the dimensionality of your feature space grows, the R -squared
value also grows. An adjusted R -squared value compensates for this
phenomenon by including a penalty for model complexity. When
testing the signi!cance of the regression as a whole, the F-test
compares the explained variance to unexplained variance. A regression
result with a high F-statistic and an adjusted R -squared over 0.7 is
almost surely signi!cant.

##### PUTTING it ALL TOGETHER


## Consumer Behavior

## Analysis from a

## Multi-Terabyte

## Dataset

Analytic Challenge

```
After storing over 10 years’ worth of retail
transaction in the natural health space, a retail
client was interested in employing advanced
machine learning techniques to mine the data for
valuable insights. The client wanted to develop a
database structure for long term implementation
of retail supply chain analytics and select the
proper algorithms needed to develop insights
into supplier, retailer, and consumer interactions.
Determining the actual worth of applying big
data analytics to the end-to-end retail supply
chain was also of particular interest.
```
Our Approach

```
The client’s data
included 3TBs of
product descriptions,
customer loyalty
information and B2B
and B2C transactions
for thousands of natural
health retailers across
North America. Because
the data had been stored
in an ad-hoc fashion, the
first step was creating
a practical database
structure to enable
analytics. We selected
a cloud environment
in order to quickly
implement analytics on
the client’s disparate
and sometimes
redundant datasets.
Once we created a
```
```
suitable analytics
architecture, we
moved on to identifying
appropriate machine
learning techniques that
would add value across
three key focus areas:
product receptivity, loyal
program analysis, and
market basket analysis.
For product receptivity,
our team used Bayesian
Belief Networks (BBN)
to develop probabilistic
models to predict the
success, failure, and
longevity of a new or
current product. We
joined transaction data
with attribute data of
both successful and
failed products to

transform the data into usable
form. Once we created this
data file, we used it to train
BBNs and create a predictive
model for future products.

For loyalty program analysis, we
joined transactional data and
customer attribute data, which
included location information
and shopping trends. We
used _k_ -means clustering to
segment customers based
on their behavior over time.
This allowed us to cluster
and characterize groups of
customers that exhibited
similar loyalty patterns.

For market basket analysis,
we employed Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA), a natural

```
language processing technique,
to create consistent product
categorization. The client’s
product categorization was
ad-hoc, having been entered
by individual suppliers and
retailers. As a result, it was
inconsistent and often contained
typographical errors or missing
values. LDA allowed our team
to use the existing text to derive
new, consistent customer
categories for the market basket
analysis. After joining the new
product categorization data
with transaction data, we used
Association Rules Learning
to identify sets of product
categories that customers
tended to purchase together at
individual retailer locations.
```
Our Impact

Our team provided key findings and recommendations to describe
how the machine learning techniques could be operationalized
to provide real-time reporting to retailers. The client received
suggestions for improving product nomenclature, product
promotions, and end-to-end visibility of the product and process
lifecycle. As an example, we used our market basket analysis to
create product recommendations for individual retail locations.
Our recommendations have the potential to improve sales
within certain product categories by up to 50% across the retail
network. Together with time savings realized from automated
data processing (such as a 300x increase in product categorization
speed), these insights demonstrated the clear value of big data
analytics to the client’s organization.

## Strategic Insights

## within Terabytes of

## Passenger Data

Analytic Challenge

```
A commercial airline client was faced with increasing market
competition and challenges in profitability. They wanted to address
these challenges with rapid deployment of advanced, globalized
analytical tools within their private electronic data warehouse.
In the past, the client had analyzed smaller datasets in-house.
Because smaller datasets are filtered or diluted subsets of the
full data, the airline had not been able to extract the holistic
understanding it was seeking.
```
```
Booz Allen was engaged to create capabilities to analyze hundreds
of gigabytes of client data. The ultimate goal was to generate
insights into airline operations, investment decisions and consumer
preferences that may not have been apparent from studying data
subsets. Specifically, the airline wanted to be able to understand
issues such as: how they perform in different city-pair markets
relative to competitors; how booking behaviors change, based on
passenger and flight characteristics; and how connection times
impact demand.
```
Our Solution

```
Due to data privacy issues, our
team set up a cloud environment
within the client’s electronic
data warehouse. Leveraging
this analytic environment,
analysis proceeded with an
approach that focused on the
client’s three priorities: market
performance, booking behavior,
and passenger choice.
We performed probabilistic
analysis using machine learning
techniques, particularly
Bayesian Belief Networks
```
```
(BBN). We merged passenger
booking and other data to
create a BBN training file. Our
team developed and validated
comprehensive BBN models
to represent significant
customer behavior and market-
based factors that influence
passenger preference, with
respect to selection of flights
by connection times. Finally,
our team developed custom big
data visualizations to convey
the findings to technical and
non-technical audiences alike.
```

Our Impact

We demonstrated the ability to rapidly deploy big data analytical
tools and machine learning on massive datasets located inside a
commercial airline’s private cloud environment. Results included
insights that seemed counterintuitive, but could improve financial
performance nonetheless. An example of one such finding was
that under certain circumstances, passengers are willing to pay a
premium to book itineraries with modified connection times. This
translates into a potential revenue increase of many millions of
dollars. These insights, often at the level of named customers, can
be acted upon immediately to improve financial performance.

## Savings Through

## Better Manufacturing

Analytic Challenge

```
A manufacturing company engaged Booz Allen to explore data
related to chemical compound production. These processes are
quite complex. They involve a long chain of interconnected events,
which ultimately leads to high variability in product output. This
makes production very expensive.
```
```
Understanding the production process is not easy – sensors collect
thousands of time series variables and thousands of point-in-
time measurements, yielding terabytes of data. There was a huge
opportunity if the client could make sense of this data. Reducing the
variance and improving the product yield by even a small amount
could result in significant cost savings.
```
Our Solution

```
Due to the size and complexity of
the process data, prior analysis
efforts that focused on data
from only a single sub-process
had limited success. Our Data
Science team took a different
approach: analyzing all the data
from all the sub-processes
with the goal of identifying the
factors driving variation. Once
we understood those factors, we
could develop recommendations
on how to control them to
increase yield. The client’s
process engineers had always
wanted to pursue this approach
but lacked the tools to carry out
the analysis.
We decomposed the problem
into a series of smaller
problems. First, it was
necessary to identify which
time series parameters likely
affected product yield. We
engaged the client’s domain
experts to identify their
```
```
hypotheses surrounding the
process. Once we discerned a
set of hypotheses, we identified
the sensors that collected the
relevant data.
We began initial data processing,
which included filtering
bad values and identifying
patterns in the time series. We
then needed to segment the
data streams into individual
production runs. We identified a
sensor that stored the high-level
information indicating when a
production process began. This
sensor provided exactly what we
needed, but we quickly noticed
that half of the expected data
was missing. Examining the
data more closely, we realized
the sensor had only been used
within recent years. We had to
take a step back and reassess
our plan. After discussions
with the domain experts, we
identified a different sensor
```
# !!

**THE FIELD GUIDE** _to_ **DATA SCIENCE**


that gave us raw values directly
from the production process.
The raw values included a tag
that indicated the start of a
production run. The sensor was
active for every production run
and could be used reliably to
segment the data streams into
production runs.

Next, we had to determine
which time series parameters
affected product yield. Using the
cleaned and processed data and
a non-parametric correlation
technique, we compared each
time series in a production
run to all other time series in
that same run. Given the pair-
wise similarities, we estimated
correlation of the similarities
to final product yield. We then
used the correlations as input
into a clustering algorithm to
find clusters of time series
parameters that correlated with
each other in terms of product
yield, not in terms of the time
series themselves. This data

```
analysis was at a scale not
previously possible – millions
of comparisons for whole
production runs. Engineers were
able to look at all the data for the
first time, and to see impacts
of specific parameters across
different batches and sensors.
In addition to identifying the
key parameters, the engineers
needed to know how to control
the parameters to increase
product yield. Discussions
with domain experts provided
insight into which time series
parameters could be easily
controlled. This limited the
candidate parameters to only
those that the process engineers
could influence. We extracted
features from the remaining
time series signals and fed
them into our models to predict
yield. The models quantified the
correlation between the pattern
of parameter values and yield,
providing insights on how to
increase product yield.
```
Our Impact

With controls identified and desirable patterns quantified, we
provided the engineers with a set of process control actions
to improve product output. The raw sensor data that came
directly from the production process drove our analysis and
recommendations, thus providing the client with confidence in the
approach. The reduction in product yield variability will enable the
client to produce a better product with lower risk at a reduced cost.

A major investment house wanted to explore whether the
application of Data Science techniques could yield increased
investment returns. In particular, the company wanted to predict
future commodity value movements based on end-of-day and
previous-day equity metrics. The client hoped the predictions
could be used to optimize their trading activities. By translating
the approach across their entire portfolio, they could dramatically
improve the yield curve for their investors.
```
```
Several challenges were immediately apparent. The data volume
was very large, consisting of information from tens of thousands
of equities, commodities, and options across most major world
markets across multiple time intervals. The need to recommend
a predictive action (go short, go long, stay, increase position size,
or engage in a particular option play) with very low latency was
an even greater challenge. The team would need to develop an
approach that addressed both of these implicit constraints.
```
Our Solution

```
The client challenged Booz
Allen to use 3,500 independent
variables to predict the daily
price movements of 16 financial
instruments. The client hid the
meaning and context of the
independent variables, however,
forcing our team to perform
analysis without qualitative
information. The team
immediately began searching
for supplemental data sources.
We identified unstructured data
from other companies, financial
institutions, governments and
social media that could be
used in our analysis. The team
paid considerable attention to
```
```
database access efficiency and
security as well as the speed
of computation.
Our team implemented
a multifaceted approach,
including a mix of neural
network optimization and a
variety of principal component,
regression, and unsupervised
learning techniques. We were
able to infer insight into small-
scale exogenous events that
provided a richer basis for
predicting localized fluctuations
in the equity prices. Our
team was able to use these
predictions to determine the
optimal combination of actions

that would generate the best
aggregate return over 12 months
of trading. Careful consideration
of the residuals and skilled

```
modeling of the variance added
additional value to the outcome
for this client.
```
Our Impact

Our Data Science team conducted an experiment to determine the
efficacy of our approach. We used our model to generate buy/sell
recommendations based on training data provided by the client.
The test cases converged on a set of recommendations in less
than ten minutes, satisfying the solution timeliness constraint. The
experiment revealed a true positive accuracy of approximately 85%
with a similar outcome for true negative accuracy when compared
against optimal recommendations based on perfect information.
The typical return on investment was, as desired, quite large.

The ability to determine the position to take, not just for a single
financial instrument but also for a complete portfolio, is invaluable
for this client. Achieving this outcome required predictive analytics
and the ability to rapidly ingest and process large data sets,
including unstructured data. This could not have been accomplished
without a diverse team of talented Data Scientists bringing the
entirety of their tradecraft to bear on the problem.
